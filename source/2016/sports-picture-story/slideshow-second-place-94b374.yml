  :caption: When Pat Manuel stepped through the ropes and into the boxing ring at
    the South El Monte Community Center last spring, it was the last step of a long
    journey, one that stretched back more than four years to Manuels last bout, in
    the 2012 Olympic Trials. Along the way he lost his coach and his gym, two jobs
    and a handful of people he once considered friends. The last time Manuel fought
    he was a she, making the three-round bout in South El Monte the first in U.S.
    professional boxing history to feature a fighter who has transitioned from female
    to male.
