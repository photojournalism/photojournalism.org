  :caption: "Every summer Sergio Colas joins hundreds of other runners for Pamplona's
    annual bull-run, but unlike them he cannot hear the roaring crowds or the bulls
    thundering through the winding streets of the Spanish town's medieval centre.\rDeaf
    from birth, Colas has to rely on the movement of the mass of people around him
    to complete the almost kilometre-long dash without being gored or trampled by
    the specially-bred bulls, which can weigh up to 650 kilograms.\r"
