NO ENTRY CAN PLAY LONGER THAN FOUR (4) MINUTES. CONTEST FORM MUSY ACCOMPANY (MAILED) CONTEST ENTRY. There are two types of multimedia entries: Single Photographer - Use this method for a multimedia entry which is the work of a single photographer. You may include this entry as part of your overall contest entry. Team Entry - Use this method when there is more than one photographer responsible for the work. If you use this method use must submit it under a separately funded contest entry. Portfolio Entries There are two types of portfolio entries for this contest: Best Portfolio or Rich Mahan Best Student Portfolio. A portfolio entry does not count as entry, and is simply a combination of the images entered in the contest categories. Photographers wishing to be considered for one of the portfolio awards should place all the photos in their portfolio entry into a folder marked with photographer's code and portfolio category. The name of your portfolio folder would look like this: ATLPJ Best Portfolio or ATLPJ Student Portfolio (ATLPJ is code used from example above). Multimedia content is not allowed in portfolio submission. Each portfolio MUST include an entry from one multiple picture category (News Picture Story, Feature Picture Story, Sports Picture Story) and from one news category (Spot News, General News, News Picture Story). Portfolios may contain no more than 10 entries. Portfolios may contain no more than 40 images total. A picture story counts (12 images max per story) as one entry. Students may enter either the Best Portfolio or the Rich Mahan Student Portfolio competition, but not both. Only students who have not yet graduated are eligible for the Student category, therefore students should enter the contest with a University affiliation listed on their entry form, not a publication. There is no need to include separate folders inside the portfolio folder, loose images inside this folder is preferred. Portfolio entries will be judged separately from Category entries so you must make copies of the category entries you wish to be considered in your portfolio entry. You may simply duplicate your category entries, placing the copies in your portfolio folder. The Rich Mahan Student Portfolio honors the memory of former Seminar Board Member Rich Mahan.

Matt Eich Matt Eich was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1986 and is the oldest of four children. He grew up in the peanut-farming town of Suffolk, Virginia and was home schooled for eight years.

Eich began working as a freelance photographer while studying photojournalism at Ohio University for clients that include National Geographic, GQ, Esquire, Mother Jones, TIME, FADER, Harper's, AARP, Apple, Tiffany &amp; Company, Republic Records and others. He is currently pursuing his MFA in Photography from the Hartford Art School.
