      - "A case study in finding strong characters and gaining access when the odds seem stacked against you. "
      - "Evolution of a story that almost wasn't explores the gritty side of video reporting and speaks to the power of taking control and navigating a field that is constantly changing and rarely goes as planned."
      - "Have you ever watched a short doc or digital film and wondered \"how did they get access to that?\" Ever discovered an incredible and captivating character only to have them flake out on you at the last minute? Or researched a story, got buy-in from a character, only to have your editor knock it down?  We've all been there. "
      - "In this workshop, we'll take a look at three stories and their not so glamorous path to creation. From one-woman-banding it on late night shoots, navigating the process of getting buy-in from editors and sometimes scrapping your entire game plan and adjusting on the fly. The focus of the workshop will be a step-by-step overview of how each of three stories came to be, from the pitch process to production-- giving a glimpse at what went wrong, what worked well, and what was learned. Also highlighted by practical tips for early-career reporters and untraditional paths to a fulfilling career."
