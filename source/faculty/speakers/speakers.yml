  - "Carolyn Potts, is a creative consultant and former artists rep who has extensive experience in the sales and marketing of assignment photography, photo editing, graphic design and user experience. She provides strategies and tactics to photographers who need effective solutions to improve their portfolios and land the assignments they want."
  - "As a successful photographers’ representative, with a global client base, she accurately anticipated market trends for over three decades. She consistently helped her photo clients stay ahead of ever-changing market conditions. Using marketing and branding strategies that set her photographers apart from those who marketed on price alone, her photographers shot for almost every blue-chip client you can name. She and her clients also survived the previous three \"worst recessions ever!\""
  - "Now a full-time creative consultant, speaker and workshop presenter, Carolyn, often works with seasoned pros who are looking to move into new markets or revitalize sagging careers. But she also helps emerging photographers understand the buying needs of middle-aged photo buyers (those who typically still influence many of the photo buying decisions). Bottom line: she helps talented and pro-active photographers who are committed learning how to bring their sales and marketing skills up to the same level of professionalism as is their photography."
  - "Based in metro-Chicago, she has strong tendencies towards wanderlust–especially in the winter. She loves meeting photographers the old-fashioned way (i.e., face-to-face at photo festivals, workshops, and trade shows). But since she's also somewhat of a geek, you can also find her working with many of her clients over Skype."
