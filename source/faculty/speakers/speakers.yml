  bio:
  - "Photographer Melissa Golden lives in Atlanta, but she isn’t really from anywhere in particular. Her work is influenced by all the places she’s called home at some point- the brazen oddity of Southern California, the tradition of the Deep South, the storm light of rural Florida, the intrigue of the Middle East and the stiff formality of the District of Columbia. Over her diverse and unlikely career, she’s toured with rock stars, gotten stuck in a secret elevator with the Speaker of the House, hitched a ride through a trailer park in a monster truck, hung out the back of an airplane over the Gulf of Mexico, and once found herself covered entirely in chihuahuas."
  - "Melissa is represented by Redux Pictures and her work has been recognized by American Photography, the White House News Photographer’s Association, the World Photography Organization and the Eddie Adams Workshop and has been shown at exhibitions in DC, LA, Stockholm and Cape Town."
  - "Her clients include Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal, ESPN Magazine, CNN, and Variety among others."
