  - "There's no need for expensive equipment or major resources to do effective storytelling. All you need is inquisitiveness and a listening ear. Oral histories are important for preserving culture and traditions, and bridging communities together. In this session, University of Mississippi journalism professor Alysia Burton Steele will share work from her book, \"Delta Jewels: In Search of My Grandmother's Wisdom.\" Steele drove 6,000 miles to interview 54 women who talked about life during the Jim Crow era in the Mississippi Delta. Her book is a collection of portraits she took and poignant stories she collected from 54 African American church women, such as a 105-year old woman thrown off a cotton plantation because she refused to have her children pick cotton, to a woman who stormed into telephone company's office and demanded \"Mrs.\" be put next to her name like her White counterparts. From this personal project came an article, from that article came a book, and from that book came a mission to explain the value of oral histories. Everyone has a story worth sharing. Learn how the author gained access to one of the hardest communities in Mississippi and get inspired to do your own project."
