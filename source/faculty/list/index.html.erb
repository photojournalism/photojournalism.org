<p>Below is an alphabetized list of most of the faculty members who have participated in the <strong>Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar</strong> since our humble beginnings in 1973. We are missing information from 1976, 1977 and 1978. We have made an effort to hyperlink each memberâ€™s name to a website with more information about them, including personal websites, articles, Wikipedia entries and obituaries.</p>

<p>Please send us an email at <strong><a href="mailto:webmaster@photojournalism.org">webmaster@photojournalism.org</a></strong> if any of the links are broken, incorrect, or you have any information on faculty members from 1976-78.</p>
