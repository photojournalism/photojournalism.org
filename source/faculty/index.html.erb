  <p>"If you learn to shoot with your heart, you’ll move peoples’ souls!"</p>

  <p>A good friend and mentor said that phrase of inspiration to Eric years ago, and it is something he thinks about constantly as a Photo and Video Journalist at the Detroit Free Press.</p>

  <p>A 1993 graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism, Eric joined the Detroit Free Press in 1999. It is the newspaper he grew up reading and wanted to work at since he first started taking pictures in high school.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Eric has covered many things from various presidential campaigns, the Intifada in Israel/Palestine, 5 months covering the war in Iraq and many sports from the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, to several Super Bowls, World Series, and NBA Finals.</p>

  <p>In May of 2008, Eric eagerly embraced video storytelling as the Detroit Free Press started the push to video on the web at Freep.com. From video features and projects to the documentary he's currently shooting, "Shipwrecks of the Great Lakes," Eric loves trying to bring a cinematic look, feel, and style to his pieces, while always staying true to the one thing that matters more than anything else... the story, the story, the story!</p>

  <p>He has been recognized for his video storytelling with the 2011 MPPA Multimedia Photographer of the Year, a national Webby Award, several POYi, NPPA-BOP awards and seven Michigan Emmys. He has taught at different workshops and seminars from the NPPA Multimedia Immersion at Syracuse, the Mountain Peoples Workshop at Western Kentucky University and the Poynter Institute.
