      - "In doing short or long form videos/documentaries especially as a \"one-man band\" it takes many small steps over time to take that first big one."
      - "If you haven't discovered already it requires lots of patience, practice, time & lots of failure at first. When all is said & done however, the wonderment of telling interesting stories about people & places makes it worth it in the end. More importantly it keeps your newspaper audience engaged & informed about their community."
      - "In my 8 years of doing video for the Detroit Free Press my small steps started with 2 minute video stories. Over time they turned into 5 minute, then 12 & 21 minute short docs."
      - "This journey I've been on of learning the point of the story before telling it, the story structure, rich audio, cinematography & editing helped set a good foundation for me to produce for the Free Press a 50 minute documentary \"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\" about a Detroit shipwreck hunter. <a href='https://vimeo.com/140599283'>https://vimeo.com/140599283</a>"

She's seen the underbelly of broadcast television, donning a navy blue suit as an NBC page and setting her alarm for 2:37am (to be exact) at Good Morning America, before launching digital video initiatives at ABC News and Bloomberg. Her work covering the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009 for ABC News earned her a News and Documentary Emmy Award – and she's received two Emmy nominees for ‘<i>Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story</i>' (Vote 2010) and '<i>New Approaches to News & Documentary Programming: Current News Coverage</i>' (ABCNews.com – Target bin Laden: The Death and Life of Public Enemy #1, 2011). New York City has been her home the entire time."

  bio:
  - In 2001, Jarrett Bellini graduated from American University with a degree in Visual Media. Which is to say that he could competently edit on VHS and build a rather cheap-looking website with all the functionality of a potato.
  - Money well spent.
  - Fortunately, when he joined CNN in 2004, the media landscape wasn't too far advanced from where he left off in college. But everything changed. Fast.
  - During his time in Atlanta at the 24-hour news network, Jarrett went on to host a popular video podcast, create a celebrity interview series, and filed reports from all over the world.
  - He also was a regular humor columnist for CNN.com. The column was called "Apparently This Matters" and that brand now exists independently as both a written piece and a new video interview series.
  - Throughout this time, technologies, graphic and shooting styles, advertiser demands, and consumer sensibilities evolved into the digital media world as we know it today. He's literally seen it all change before his eyes.
  - And somehow he's managed to stay relevant.
  - Now, as a senior producer for CNBC Digital – the world's leading business news network - Jarrett continues to tell stories and cover major events through his lens, most recently reporting from the RNC and DNC.

      - Content is everywhere. And we only have so many minutes in the day. So, how can you make your video the one somebody clicks ... and hopefully for more than the three requisite seconds Facebook requires for it to actually count as a view.
