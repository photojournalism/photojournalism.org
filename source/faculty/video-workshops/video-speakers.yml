  - "Francis has been Director of Photography at Blue Chalk Media for the past three years where he was worked on films for National Geographic TV, TBrand Studio, Bloomberg, NBC Universal, The New York Times, Discovery Education, The Weather Channel and others."

  - "While working at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida, Francis covered news events throughout the world traveling to more than 45 countries.

Earlier this year, on an assignment for National Geographic TV to Antartica, Francis reached his seventh continent."
