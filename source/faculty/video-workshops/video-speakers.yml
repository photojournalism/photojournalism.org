  - "Over the last 13 years, Courtney has run the gamut across the media landscape. She’s seen the underbelly of broadcast television, donning a navy blue suit as an NBC page and setting her alarm for 2:37am (to be exact) at Good Morning America, before launching digital video initiatives at ABC News and Bloomberg. Her work covering the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009 for ABC News earned her a News and Documentary Emmy Award – and she’s received two Emmy nominees for ‘<i>Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story</i>' (Vote 2010) and '<i>New Approaches to News & Documentary Programming: Current News Coverage</i>’ (ABCNews.com – Target bin Laden: The Death and Life of Public Enemy #1, 2011). New York City has been her home the entire time."
