      - "There has never been a more dynamic time to be a visual journalist. In recent years, print and radio-based news outlets have embraced the power of video storytelling, breaking the confines of broadcast traditions to produce stories that are both emotionally and visually impactful. In this session Kassie Bracken will breakdown the elements necessary to craft compelling and memorable video stories (here's a mantra: motion + emotion + great sound!) Covered in this session will be the \"language\" of video - shooting in sequences and capturing great opening moments and transitional shots, as well as other important considerations like how to pre-produce your story and how to gain the trust of a subject to capture intimate and meaningful scenes and interviews. She will provide the backstory to her own work examples and discuss different types of kits she brings to various assignments."
