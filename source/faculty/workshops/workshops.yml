  workshop:
    - description:
      - "The reality for photographers working in the editorial, corporate, and non-profit fields is such that photographers' rights to maintain control over the distribution of their images has been eroded with the evolution to digital publishing. Todd's talks will draw from a section of his workshop dealing with the important role contracts, licensing and combating infringement play in a freelance photographer's life. We will analyze real contracts offered by clients, view real requests from publishers while discussing licensing options, and touch on ways to combat and recover licensing fees lost to digital infringement. "
      - "Todd will present three workshops that can be attended individually or together:<br>- Image Licensing<br>- Contracts<br>- Copyright and Combating Infringement"

  - "Photographer Melissa Golden lives in Atlanta, but she isn't really from anywhere in particular. Over her diverse and unlikely career, she's toured with rock stars, gotten stuck in a secret elevator with the Speaker of the House, hitched a ride through a flooded trailer park in a monster truck, hung out the back of an airplane over the Gulf of Mexico, and once found herself covered entirely in chihuahuas."
  - "A photojournalist by training, she's been making portraits for the pages and covers of magazines for years and by now has met and stolen the souls of the tech, business and political world's biggest newsmakers. With her camera, of course."
  - "Melissa is represented by Redux Pictures and her clients include Fast Company, ESPN Magazine, CNN, People, and Variety among others."
