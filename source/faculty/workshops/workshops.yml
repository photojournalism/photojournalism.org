  workshop:
    - description:
      - "The reality for photographers working in the editorial, corporate, and non-profit fields is such that photographers' rights to maintain control over the distribution of their images has been eroded with the evolution to digital publishing. Todd's talks will draw from a section of his workshop dealing with the important role contracts, licensing and combating infringement play in a freelance photographer's life. We will analyze real contracts offered by clients, view real requests from publishers while discussing licensing options, and touch on ways to combat and recover licensing fees lost to digital infringement. "
      - "Todd will present three workshops that can be attended individually or together:"
      - "Image Licensing: Students will learn of the importance for freelancers to create licensing revenue to help defray the costs of operating a business. Real requests from clients for use of photographs will be displayed along with the final terms and conditions of the license so students can learn how to navigate the process. We will also discuss various licensing models and ways to build and manage your archive in order to best leverage your work for licensing revenue. Model releases will also be discussed."
      - "Contracts: Contracts are the most common way of doing business in the world of freelance photography. Corporations, publishers, non-profits and others typically ask photographers to sign contracts before they can accept work. Students will have the chance to see and analyze real contracts (redacted) distributed by various clients and learn why particular clauses are extremely important to your business and future income. We will also discuss the need for photographers to create their own contracts for use in their business."
      - "Copyright and Combating Infringement: Students will learn the basics of copyright law and how to use the knowledge to effectively register and protect their photographs from unauthorized use. In conjunction, infringement is a serious issue that deprives photographers of necessary licensing revenue, so students will learn of options to combat infringement while recovering lost revenue. Real (redacted) email exchanges between photographer and infringer will be displayed to provide additional insight."
