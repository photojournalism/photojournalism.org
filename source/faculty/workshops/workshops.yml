  - "In May of 2008, Eric eagerly embraced video storytelling as the Detroit Free Press started the push to video on the web at Freep.com. From video features and projects to the documentary he's currently shooting, \"Shipwrecks of the Great Lakes,\" Eric loves trying to bring a cinematic look, feel, and style to his pieces, while always staying true to the one thing that matters more than anything else... the story, the story, the story!"
