  :comments: "There is only one decisive moment in capturing the peak action of sport. The moment just before or just after that moment is simply too early or too late. Study sports action images hard before entering this category. We had many entries but judged this one fast. Know the difference between Sports Action and Sports Feature before entering this category."

  :comments: "These entries can’t be pedestrian. It’s real photojournalism. and has to be all in – completely engaged, bullets flying, personal safety behind making the images, in the line of fire – and yet still seeing, working, shooting and capturing the moments within the moments. The Haiti essay reflected perfectly what the Hondros Memorial Award is about: it is for completely engaged photographers shooting conflict in danger, immersed in the action and emotion of terrifying moments."

  :comments: "This dominated the year by very strong work from overseas, the winners being stories and pictures which rose above the rest. The judges would like to underline to the photo community that for enterprising photographers, there are great stories, important stories, richly photogenic stories which live all around us. If you call yourself a photojournalist, and understand the power of pictures to tell human stories, we would hope that entries next year will include stories shot within a block, within a mile, within a neighborhood of our photographers."

  :comments: "This category is exclusively for telling the truth about a situation, subject, or event. There is no room for puff public relations pieces shot by pros who work in production as opposed to journalism. We disqualified a number of entries this year for this reason. The two stories we voted on for first and second places were both strong, but we held back on third this year."
