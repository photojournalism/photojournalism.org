    job in the Israeli army to pursue a childhood dream: becoming a mermaid. Ever
    since getting hooked on Disneys The Little Mermaid as a kid, Katzenell confided,
    she has longed to turn into one. While her friends moved on, Katzenells enchantment
    with mermaids endured. She fantasized about swimming underwater alongside fish
    in a 10-pound tail and sequined bikini. Then she actually gave it a try. As it
    turns out, shes not the only one. Together with a friend and fellow mermaid-fan,
    Michelle Koretsky, she started an unlikely social scene: a group of aspiring mermaids
    in Israel, which has grown on Facebook to nearly 1,000 members. Its the Israeli
    pocket of a worldwide community that she claims is gaining prominence. It was
    a crazy revelation, said Katzenell. I realized I was part of something big.\r\rIn
