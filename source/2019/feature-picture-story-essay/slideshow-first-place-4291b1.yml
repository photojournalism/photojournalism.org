    the vast body of water into a polluted wasteland as boom turns to bust. Nobody
    lives as closely with the environmental fallout as hundreds of crab fishermen
    who scratch out an existence on its perpetually oil-soaked shores. Production
    in Venezuela has crashed to a fifth of its high two decades ago, leaving behind
    abandoned and broken equipment. Crude oozes from hundreds of rusting platforms
    and cracked pipelines throughout the briny tidal bay. \r\rFabiola Elizalzabal

    Lake Maracaibo, next to an oil-covered shore in Cabimas, Venezuela, July 3, 2019.
    The lake is an apocalyptic scene that's getting worse as oil-soaked gunk of trash
    and driftwood lines its shore. "
