  :caption: "Story Description: Johnny Quinn, 40, of Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania had
    no visions of becoming a professional bodybuilder as kid when his life changed
    dramatically 19 years ago. In 1998, while working as an auto-mechanic, a nearly
    fatal motorcycle accident paralyzed him resulting in no motor function below his
    chest. After a grueling first year, he began to get acclimated to life in a wheelchair
    and decided to go to the gym in hopes of counteract the muscle loss and weight
    gain that followed his accident. It was in an issue of Flex Magazine where he
    learned about a novice wheelchair bodybuilding show. In 2010, he became the National
    Physique Committee Wheelchair Champion. Winning this annual amateur contest earned
    him an elite classification as only 1 of 23 professional wheelchair bodybuilders
    on the globe through the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness
    (IFBB) - the highest level of bodybuilding in the world. As a result, Quinn has
    traveled worldwide to compete on the most respected stages in more than 30 events
    as he chases the ultimate high of appearing on the Mr. Olympia stage - the Super
    Bowl of bodybuilding. Surviving a horrific accident, and forming a new identity
    in the process, he vows to himself and others to never give up.\r\rMALVERN, PA

    represents the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 - I can do all things through Christ
    who strengthens me - is detailed as he trains at Everfit gym on April 19, 2017
