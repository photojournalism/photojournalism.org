  :caption: "Story Description: On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb detonation
    took place in a test explosion near Socorro, New Mexico, setting into motion an
    arms race that needed one main raw ingredient: weapons-grade uranium. Land in
    the American Southwest that was made up of barren desert scrub brush and sandstone
    mesas was found to be incredibly rich in uranium ore. The people of the Navajo
    Nation sat on some of the largest uranium deposits in the world. Hundreds of mines
    were opened and a boom began. But as is so often the case with indigenous populations,
    the vast majority of Navajos did not benefit from their own natural resources
    and unemployment now rests above 40 percent. Decades of irresponsible mining,
    chemical dumping, and radioactive spills have left large swathes of the Navajo
    Nation with crystal clear, yet contaminated and undrinkable ground water. More
    than a decade has passed since the last uranium was mined on Navajo land, but
    the death and disease it brought is far less removed. Over 30,000 sick Navajo
    miners have been compensated under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act that
    awards a cash sum to those who can prove that they are sick or dying from their
    time spent working in the mines. Many more will die in the coming years, but their
    legacy is lost on much of the country. The president has called for a second nuclear
    arms race as miners still die from the first. In Navajo tradition, four sacred
    mountains are said to mark the edges of the Navajos land and are believed to watch
    over the people. In one prayer, the four mountains speak to the Navajo saying:
    My child I will feed you, give you good health, and I will give you strength and
    courage. My child I will give you clean air and clean water to drink. I am your
    Life. But from beneath the mountains on the Navajo Nation Reservation have come
    some of the richest deposits of uranium in the world, and with them sickness,
    suffering, pain, and loss. Today, the Navajo know this bitter irony all too well.
    They live it.\r\r************************\r\rDo you want me to show you where
    I dreamed of the water running? Desaire Gaddy muses. All through here, just blue
    water and dolphins. As dusk approaches, Desaire explores the dry scrubland that
    surrounds her rural home outside of Thoreau, NM. Gaddy was moved back onto the
    Navajo Nation Reservation from her life in Florida to stay with relatives who
    live without running water due to the ongoing water crisis. Most children grow
    up on the reservation knowing nothing of another life, but not she."
