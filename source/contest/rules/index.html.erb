<p><em><strong>ETHICAL STATEMENT</strong>: We do not allow any sort of manipulation to the content of an image, with the exception of our photo illustration categories. This includes Instagram-type effects or filters on photos taken with phones or other devices. Only basic color correction and cropping are allowed to maintain the integrity and ethical standards of the industry. Normal burning and dodging is acceptable, so long as not to eliminate or obscure subject matter. It is our responsibility as photojournalists to document and present images in an honest manner. As a result, the judging panel or members of the board may disqualify any images that do not meet the ethical standards put forth.</em></p>
