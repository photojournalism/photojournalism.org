    of Islamic State militant held territory in and around Mosul, Iraq. The Battle
    of Mosul is a joint offensive by Iraqi government forces with allied militias,
    Iraqi Kurdistan, and international forces to retake the city of Mosul from the
    Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The offensive, dubbed Operation \"We
    Are Coming, Nineveh\" began on 16 October 2016 with forces besieging ISIL-controlled
    areas in the Nineveh Governorate surrounding Mosul. The battle for Mosul is considered
    key in the military intervention against ISIL, which seized the city in June 2014.\r\rA
