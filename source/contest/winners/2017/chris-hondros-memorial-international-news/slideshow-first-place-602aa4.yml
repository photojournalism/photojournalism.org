  :caption: 'A woman checks on dry fruit on top of Asheghaan-Arefaan neighborhood
    of Kabul, Afghanistan. There is a certain bleakness assumed by a country that
    has been plagued by decades of war.  In Afghanistan particularly, the landscape
    gives evidence of warfarebeggars wounded by bomb blasts grovel for spare change,
    educational opportunities are sparse, and citizens struggle to provide their families
    with basic necessities, even safe drinking water.  Yet in the midst of this hardship,
    there exists a vibrant civilian lifeone that is equally religious, playful and
    beautifully mundane. Small family-owned shops buzz with business, mosques host
    religious ceremonies, children turn trash into playgrounds, and neighbors play
    games in the streets.   Afghanis perhaps best exhibit the resiliency of human
    spirit. '
