    as a homeless family on the streets of San Francisco, but Jamal explains that
    the only solution is patience. In one of the wealthiest cities in the United States,
    income inequality is grossly apparent. "Remember what it was like to be low, so
    when you're high you can be kind," says Brittany. "When you're homeless, people
    tend to treat you bad and rudely. Remember when you're back on top to have compassion."

  :caption: "Story Description: On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb detonation
    took place in a test explosion near Socorro, New Mexico, setting into motion an
    arms race that needed one main raw ingredient: weapons-grade uranium. Land in
    the American Southwest that was made up of barren desert scrub brush and sandstone
    mesas was found to be incredibly rich in uranium ore. The people of the Navajo
    Nation sat on some of the largest uranium deposits in the world. Hundreds of mines
    were opened and a boom began. But as is so often the case with indigenous populations,
    the vast majority of Navajos did not benefit from their own natural resources
    and unemployment now rests above 40 percent. Decades of irresponsible mining,
    chemical dumping, and radioactive spills have left large swathes of the Navajo
    Nation with crystal clear, yet contaminated and undrinkable ground water. More
    than a decade has passed since the last uranium was mined on Navajo land, but
    the death and disease it brought is far less removed. Over 30,000 sick Navajo
    miners have been compensated under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act that
    awards a cash sum to those who can prove that they are sick or dying from their
    time spent working in the mines. Many more will die in the coming years, but their
    legacy is lost on much of the country. The president has called for a second nuclear
    arms race as miners still die from the first. In Navajo tradition, four sacred
    mountains are said to mark the edges of the Navajos land and are believed to watch
    over the people. In one prayer, the four mountains speak to the Navajo saying:
    My child I will feed you, give you good health, and I will give you strength and
    courage. My child I will give you clean air and clean water to drink. I am your
    Life. But from beneath the mountains on the Navajo Nation Reservation have come
    some of the richest deposits of uranium in the world, and with them sickness,
    suffering, pain, and loss. Today, the Navajo know this bitter irony all too well.
    They live it.\r\r************************\r\rDo you want me to show you where
    I dreamed of the water running? Desaire Gaddy muses. All through here, just blue
    water and dolphins. As dusk approaches, Desaire explores the dry scrubland that
    surrounds her rural home outside of Thoreau, NM. Gaddy was moved back onto the
    Navajo Nation Reservation from her life in Florida to stay with relatives who
    live without running water due to the ongoing water crisis. Most children grow
    up on the reservation knowing nothing of another life, but not she."

    2017: \"You are walking in the desert before dawn when you come to great pit.
    The pit extends as far as you can see. It is full of scaffolding & cranes & half-built
    skyscrapers & new condos. Workers in hardhats & orange vests rush about, lifting
    beams & digging trenches & welding things to other things. They are building a
    brand new city in the pit, a city of right angles & white paint & freshly cut
    stone. A city of tomorrow. Then the sun rises over the horizon & sunlight beams
    into the pit. Where the sunlight hits it melts the pit-city, the half-built structures
    turning into water, the scaffolding collapsing into puddles. They have built pit-city
    out of ice. They must have known it would melt when the sun came out. You decide
    to write a song about this, a song called The Ballad of Pit City. Before you can
    write the song you need to find a guitar. You walk down into Pit City, hoping
    to find a music store or a pawn shop, but all the buildings have melted. The workers
    are huddled in the shady edges of the pit. You walk up to a worker & ask where
    you might find a guitar. Not here, the worker says, not now. But you should try
    tomorrow. We rebuild this city every night once the sun goes down. You thank the
    worker & walk through the flooded puddles of the melted city. And who is this
    person walking beside you, carrying a bundle of firewood? It is enough to know
    they are a friend.\""

  :caption: Like many residents of the Tres Colonias neighborhoods of Fort Collins,
    Jose Sandoval was first drawn to the area for its cheap homes for farm laborers.
    He came from Chihuahua, Mexico in 1975 and eventually bought his home for $14,000.
    With expansive development and the New Belgium Brewing company just across the
    street, home prices have soared (one recently sold for over $350,000). Sandoval
    and others are losing their neighborhood.

  :caption: My sister Natalie and her Imogen. "When I take her down to the waters
    edge, when I hold her tiny foot in the cold, and clear, when I stand in it and
    splash for her entertainment, all the waters from all these histories collide.
    From the puddle of amniotic fluid that soaked my toes in the hospital to the puddles
    I couldnt leap while pregnant, from the laboring hallucinations and flashbacks
    to the contractions like waves, from the obsidian pools of her eyes just opening
    to her searching, piercing expressions, all water flows to the lowest point. Imogens
    eyes dig into me, hollowing and filling me. Her eyes, like whetstones on which
    I must drag my meanings and hone my understanding, ask and ask and ask. Water
    always flows to the deepest place." Natalie. Shot on 120 film.
