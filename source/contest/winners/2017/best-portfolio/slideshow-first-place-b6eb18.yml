    it caused severe destruction. From there it dropped as much as 40 inches of rain
    as the system slowly made its way along the Texas coastline causing massive flooding
    especially in and around Houston. Harvey caused at least 90 deaths and some estimate
    the damage in the 200 billion dollar range.\r\rDonna Raney makes her way out of
    the wreckage of her home as Daisy Graham tells her she will help her out of the
    window after Hurricane Harvey destroyed the apartment in Rockport, Texas. Donna
    survived by hiding in the shower after the roof blew off and the walls of her
    home caved in by the winds of Hurricane Harvey. "
