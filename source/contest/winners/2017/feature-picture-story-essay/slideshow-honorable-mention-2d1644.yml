    icebreaker MSV Nordica as it sails the Arctic''s Northwest Passage, Friday, July
    21, 2017.If parts of the planet are becoming like a furnace because of global
    warming, then the Arctic is best described as the worlds air-conditioning unit.
    The frozen north plays a crucial role in cooling the rest of the planet while
    reflecting some of the suns heat back into space. Yet for several decades, satellite
    pictures have shown a dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice that is already affecting
    the lives of humans and animals in the region. Experts predict that the impact
    of melting sea ice will be felt across the northern hemisphere, altering ocean
    currents and causing freak weather as far south as Florida or France. '

    the Northwest Passage through the Victoria Strait in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
    Friday, July 21, 2017. Once the ship entered the fabled Northwest Passage between
    the Atlantic and the Pacific, there would be nowhere to stop for supplies, no
    port to shelter in and no help for hundreds of miles if things went wrong. A change
    in the weather might cause the mercury to drop suddenly or push the polar pack
    into the Canadian Archipelago, creating a sea of rock-hard ice. '

    precise GPS locations that help them dodge dangerous shallows. But technology
    can be fickle. After two weeks at sea the ships fragile internet connection went
    down for six days: no emails, no Google, no new satellite pictures to preview
    the route ahead. '

    sea ice in the foreseeable future. Even in the best-case scenario envisaged by
    the 2015 Paris climate accord, sea ice will largely vanish from the Arctic during
    the summer within the coming decades. '

    the world which covers roughly 80 percent of the country. Greenland''s glaciers
    have been melting and retreating at an accelerated pace in recent years due to
    warmer temperatures. If all of that ice melts, sea levels will rise by several
    meters, though there will be regional differences. '

    is hoping to learn more about the Northwest Passage to aid her work in energy
    development in the Arctic. Gritsenko, is making her first transit through the
    passage but has been to Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic. "I love
    the Arctic. It''s such a powerful nature that I felt so little in comparison,"
    she said. "It makes you realize how much of dust you are on this planet. It''s
    very intimidating but I felt very calm inside." '

    MSV Nordica as it sails through the Victoria Strait while traversing the Arctic''s
    Northwest Passage, Friday, July 21, 2017. Sea ice forms when the top layer of
    water reaches freezing point, usually around the start of October. As temperatures
    continue to fall this first-year ice grows downward until it is several feet thick.
    If the ice survives the following summer melt it becomes second-year ice. Another
    cycle and it becomes multi-year ice, which is the toughest kind. '

    and a hardened bow and hull that allow it either to drive through thin layers
    of ice or to crush thicker sheets by rising onto the ice with the help of its
    rounded hull. The ships massive weight breaks the ice from above. '

    ice that had survived several summer melts, becoming hard as concrete in the process,
