    3, 2017.\r\rBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE STORY: \"CUBA HOTSPOTS\"\r\rAt dusk, when the
    worst of the Caribbean heat has subsided, parks around Cuba fill with families
    video chatting with loved ones abroad or scrolling through social media, their
    animated faces lit by telephone and tablet screens. They have waited the whole
    day for this moment.\rThe introduction of state run Wi-Fi hotspots in Cuban public
    spaces two years ago has transformed the Communist-run island that had been mostly
    offline.\rCubans who can afford pre-paid scratch cards allowing Wi-Fi access flock
    to 432 outdoor hotspots where they brave ants, mosquitoes and the elements. Here
    they laugh, cry, shout, and whisper, or those who can, get into cars for some
    privacy.   \r"
