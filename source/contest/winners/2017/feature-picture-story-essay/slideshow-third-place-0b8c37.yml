    transformed into a park. Conservationists complain that a year after the transformation
    from zoo to park, the remaining animals still live in antiquated enclosures widely
    considered inhumane by modern standards. A year after the zoo closed its doors
    and was transformed into a park, hundreds of animals remain behind bars and in
    a noisy limbo. Developers last July promised to relocate most of the zoo's animals
    to sanctuaries in Argentina and abroad, but they had made no firm arrangements
    to do so.\r\rIn this July 5, 2016 photo, a tapir rests its hooves on the edge
    of an opening of an enclosure at the former city zoo now known as Eco Parque,
    in Buenos Aires, Argentina. "
