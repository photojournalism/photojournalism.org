  :caption: Dozens of counties across the country voted Republican for the first time
    in decades suggesting there was something about Trump specifically that spoke
    to those voters in a way no Republican had before. Ultimately, they were the people
    and places that handed him the presidency. While many voters talked about wanting
    change," the issues that were crucial to those voters vary from county to county.
    President Donald Trump is sworn in during a live broadcast of the inauguration
    as Denny Riebe, from right, Doug Dickman, Scott Reilly, and Bill Winter, play
    cards at the Sawmill Saloon in Prairie du Chien, Wisc., Friday, Jan. 20, 2017.
    So many voters switched from blue to red in fifty counties stretching 300 miles
    down the Mississippi River, through Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois, that
    it transformed in one election season into Trump Country.

    our identity." '

    lot at the paper mill compared to when he worked there a few years ago in Jay,
    Maine, Friday, March 17, 2017. Look at this parking lot. Its just amazing. At
    this time of day this parking lot was absolutely full: thats people, that''s jobs,
    thats families," said Lovewell who voted for Trump. To hear friends and colleagues
    that are leaving, walking out the last time at 40 or 50 years old. What do you
    do? Its scary." Thousands have lost jobs in the mills in the last decade, as the
    paper industry plummeted. '

  :caption: Hilton Kelley tosses his petition clipboard in frustration as he's turned
    away from a renter who was told by her landlord not to get involved in Kelley's
    attempt to shutdown the dump across the street piled with flood damaged debris
    in Port Arthur, Texas, Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017. This is an outrage. This is
    appalling. Theres no way this should have happened," said Kelly of the dump's
    proximity to people's homes. He worried about mold and other contaminants from
    the garbage getting into the low-income African American neighborhood. These are
    the neighborhoods, he said, that often pay the price for environmental pollution.
    This historically Democratic county, home to a quarter-million people, is among
    the low-lying coastal areas that stand the most to lose as the ice caps melt and
    the seas warm and rise. Yet in November, voters flipped to vote for President
    Donald Trump, the first Republican they chose in 44 years, who has dismissed the
    concept of climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China.

    for customers in Wauzeka, Wisc., Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. The mom-and-pop grocery
    store has been a fixture in the community for more than 100 years. But the owners
    -- who hope to retire and have had the store on the real estate market for a few
    years with no takers -- say business has slowed, partly because residents are
    willing to travel longer distances to shop at grocery and big box stores in Prairie
    du Chien. The county is one of dozens in middle America that switched from blue
    to red in November, but these Trump voters arent looking for changes on immigration
    or refugees and if promises of an economic renaissance arent fulfilled, they warn
    that Trump could be out four years from now. '

    Rico, some here found themselves in quiet moments pondering what has become some
    of the most polarizing questions in American political discourse: have human beings
    altered the earth so profoundly it is making bad storms more brutal? And what
    should we do about it now? '

    life following Hurricane Harvey in Port Arthur, Texas, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017.
    Hes not too up on global warming, and thats a shame, Christopher said of the president
    he supported in November, and supports still. He also believes in the consensus
    among scientists that climate change is real and that this disastrous run of weather,
    from droughts in the west to wildfires to catastrophic hurricanes along the coasts,
    is a preview of the future if the country doesnt begin to take the problem seriously.

    often recite two facts about their hometown, the first one proudly: It is the

    There are no rusted-out manufacturing plants to embody this discontent. The downtown

    at the seething resentment that life still seems harder here than it should. '
