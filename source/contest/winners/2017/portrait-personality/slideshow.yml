    inside her home in Sedow south Kashmir. Insha says she was standing by the window
    of her village home watching protesters and troops skirmish when more than a 100
    pellets hit her face, "Everything looks dark and black,". Five-months after she
    lost her eyes Malik is still learning how to deal with her loss, both emotionally
    and practically. Indian authorities call the shotgun shells filled with hundreds
    of small metal pellets a "non-lethal" weapon for crowd control, but that does
    not make them harmless. They''ve inflicted a permanent toll on hundreds of Kashmiris
    hit by them. '
