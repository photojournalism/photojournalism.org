  :caption: Athletes clean their boxing camp in Bangkok, Thailand. Muay Thai, a form
    of kickboxing, brings Thailand together in revelry and sport. Across the country,
    from cities to remote villages, people relish the excitement of this combat sport,
    as participants and spectators. In large cities, Muay Thai camps teach the art
    of eight limbs to tourists and city dwellers. They also train young men and women
    at no cost, teaching them physical and mental discipline with the intent to produce
    a champion that will bring money and honor back to the camp. Tiew, a 15-year-old
    fighter and known as the best in his camp, grew up in a village 290 miles from
    Bangkok. Like many poor villagers struggling to support their children, Tiews
    parents sent him to a camp in Bangkok to begin his Muay Thai career at age 6.
    After years of immersing himself fully in his training, Tiew returned to his place
    of birth on New Years to compete in the championships.
