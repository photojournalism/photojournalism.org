    civilian victims. Thousands were forcibly disappeared, their corpses never found.
    Thanks to numerous exhumations and DNA analysis, the war victims are finally being
    identified and properly buried. This process has marked the beginning of an extraordinary
    healing process in both rural and urban families.\rYet for some, it goes beyond
    finding and burying a family member, as it is also evidence of heinous crimes
    committed during the war. On May 10, 2013, former de facto head of state Efrain
    Rios Montt, who ruled from 1982 to 1983, was convicted of Genocide and crimes
    against humanity. Even though the conviction was overturned shortly after due
    to a technicality, it marks the first time in world history a former head of state
    is tried for genocide in a national court. Currently, eight former high-ranking
    officers await trial for the largest case of mass disappearance in the history
    of Latin America after 533 corpses were exhumed in 2012 from mass graves in a
    former military installation.\r\rCaption:\rPanorama of the Chixoy Dam and Rio
    Negro Community from Pak'oxom Peak. On March 13, 1982, the Guatemalan army and
    civil patrolmen from neighboring Xococ rounded up residents of Rio Negro, marched
    them uphill to Pakoxom, and brutally raped and massacred 177 women and children.
    Nearly 400 community members of Rio Negro were killed in four separate massacres
    in the early 1980s due to the communitys resistance to give up their lands and
    make way for the Chixoy hydroelectric project."

    the Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala (FAFG) identifies and returns
    her sister Sebastiana Iboy Sic, who was twenty-six years old at the time of her
    abduction, and her four children. Dorotea watched as all five were taken by helicopter
    during the May 14, 1982, Los Encuentros Massacre. It is very likely that all five
    were also exhumed in 2012 from grave XV at the UN's CREOMPAZ training center,
    formerly Coban's Military Zone 21. During the massacre, Guatemalan soldiers and
    civil patrolmen killed 79 community members from Rio Negro who were hiding here
    after the previous two massacres of February and March of the same year. Eyewitnesses
    assured that at least 15 other community members were abducted in a helicopter.
    As of May 2016, CREOMPAZ's grave XV has rendered positive DNA matches of the remains
    of two victims abducted in the helicopter on such day.
