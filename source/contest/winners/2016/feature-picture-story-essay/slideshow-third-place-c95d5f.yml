  :caption: "This series of portraits is focused on the life of gay people in Russia.
    It is a visual tale of melancholy, loneliness and uncertainty about the future.
    \rIn Russia the level of intolerance toward homosexuality has been rising sharply.
    A 2013 survey found that 74% of Russians said homosexuality should not be accepted
    by society. 16% of Russians surveyed said that gay people should be isolated from
    society, 22% said they should be forced to undergo treatment, and 5% said homosexuals
    should be liquidated\". \rThis reality has driven the gay community underground,
    to the shadows. In Russia only 1% of the gay population dares to live openly.
    That is why the general mood in my work is dark and melancholic. The visual concept
    mirrors the idea that being gay in Russia is not a rainbow colored life. In our
    country rainbows have some very somber shades.\rSasha, 22 years old, poses for
    a portrait at his apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia. I am the only son of my
    parents. If I tell them that I am gay, I will get nothing for myself, but they
    will be absolutely devastated. All sense of their life... just bang!  it will
    get rotten."

    already 26.

    Russia. One of the reasons for moving to St. Petersburg is a desire to live openly
    in a big city. If you had asked me before moving if I was gay  I would have said
    "no".

  :caption: Oleg, 27 years old, poses for a portrait at his apartment in St. Petersburg,
    Russia. Remember the magazine Rovesnik? Every month me and my mom went to Soyuzpechat*
    kiosk. And once Brad Pitt was on the cover. Actually, I don't like Brad Pitt...
    Anyway, mom bought me the magazine, and I took and kissed the cover for some reason.
    I can't explain why I did it. But mom was perplexed. *Soyuzpechat is a network
    of press kiosks existing in USSR.
