    couldn''t afford to pay the rent for their house without the help of their single
    parent mother, so the landlord evicted them within a week of Adriana''s detainment.
    The day prior to moving, the siblings were forced to sleep in a hotel after the
    landlord locked the door to their house, and woke up early to say goodbye to their
    home and pack. While moving into their new apartment, the only hope they could
