    trying to reach the United States, try to jump a border fence to cross illegally
    from Mexico to the U.S, in Tijuana, Mexico, December 2, 2018. The faces of migrants
    whose trek from Central America to the United States has transfixed the continent.
    As they drew closer to the U.S. border with Mexico, the thousands of mostly Honduran
    migrants became a symbol of U.S. President Donald Trump's tough policies on immigration.\rThe
    journey, made partly on foot, is punishing. And for those who reach the Mexican
    border city of Tijuana, the way forward is uncertain. U.S. officials have implemented
    a system of \"metering,\" which limits how many can seek asylum in Tijuana.\rSome
    migrants scramble over the border to avoid a months-long wait, handing themselves
    in to authorities in the hope they will be released."
