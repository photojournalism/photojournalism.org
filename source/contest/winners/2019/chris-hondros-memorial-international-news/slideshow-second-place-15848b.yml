  :caption: "Ever since India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947,
    the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir has been at the center of conflict between
    the two nations. The neighboring nuclear rivals have fought several wars over
    the region, which both claim in its entirety. In recent years, the Indian-controlled
    portion has seen renewed rebel attacks and repeated public protests against Indian
    rule, which has left more than 400 dead this past year, the highest in a decade.
    India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, a charge Pakistan denies.
    Most Kashmiris support the rebels cause while also participating in civilian street
    protests against Indian control. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the
    uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\r\r\rA masked Kashmiri protester
