    Nicaragua depend on lobster fishing to eke out a living, and like hundreds have
    been stricken with the bends, decompression sickness caused when nitrogen bubbles
    form in divers' bodies. Some are paralyzed. Some are killed. An average 10-pound
    daily haul of lobster is a windfall for people in one of the most impoverished
    regions of the Americas, so many take the risk, and many suffer for it. Safe standard
    diving techniques call for a gradual ascent to the surface to eliminate the nitrogen
    that the body's tissues absorb during a dive, and for a limit to the number of
    dives a person makes in a day. Many of the divers of Mosquitia dive deeply, surface
    quickly and then go back for more, racing to collect as much lobster as possible.
    The boats, where they spend days playing cards and talking among themselves between
    dives, often have only rudimentary safety equipment and use aging tanks and masks.\r\r
