  :caption: "Migrants from Honduras, part of a caravan of thousands from Central America
    trying to reach the United States, try to jump a border fence to cross illegally
    from Mexico to the U.S, in Tijuana, Mexico, December 2, 2018. The faces of migrants
    whose trek from Central America to the United States has transfixed the continent.
    As they drew closer to the U.S. border with Mexico, the thousands of mostly Honduran
    migrants became a symbol of U.S. President Donald Trump's tough policies on immigration.\rThe
    journey, made partly on foot, is punishing. And for those who reach the Mexican
    border city of Tijuana, the way forward is uncertain. U.S. officials have implemented
    a system of \"metering,\" which limits how many can seek asylum in Tijuana.\rSome
    migrants scramble over the border to avoid a months-long wait, handing themselves
    in to authorities in the hope they will be released."

    the vast body of water into a polluted wasteland as boom turns to bust. Nobody
    lives as closely with the environmental fallout as hundreds of crab fishermen
    who scratch out an existence on its perpetually oil-soaked shores. Production
    in Venezuela has crashed to a fifth of its high two decades ago, leaving behind
    abandoned and broken equipment. Crude oozes from hundreds of rusting platforms

    and driftwood lines its shore. "

  :caption: "STORY 1 - Thousands of men across the Mosquitia region of Honduras and
    Nicaragua depend on lobster fishing to eke out a living, and like hundreds have
    been stricken with the bends, decompression sickness caused when nitrogen bubbles
    form in divers' bodies. Some are paralyzed. Some are killed. An average 10-pound
    daily haul of lobster is a windfall for people in one of the most impoverished
    regions of the Americas, so many take the risk, and many suffer for it. Safe standard
    diving techniques call for a gradual ascent to the surface to eliminate the nitrogen
    that the body's tissues absorb during a dive, and for a limit to the number of
    dives a person makes in a day. Many of the divers of Mosquitia dive deeply, surface
    quickly and then go back for more, racing to collect as much lobster as possible.
    The boats, where they spend days playing cards and talking among themselves between
    dives, often have only rudimentary safety equipment and use aging tanks and masks.\r\r
