  :caption: "Atlanta Police S.W.A.T. officers talked a man down from the roof of a
    Midtown Atlanta home after more than nine hours of negotiations on Friday, March
    15, 2019. The unidentified man had been on the roof of a home in the 300 block
    of 4th Street since 5:15 a.m. Friday, police said.  Atlanta police are reopened
    multiple streets that were closed as a result of the hours-long negotiations.
    Resident Eric Johnson said the man climbed up to his neighbors roof after breaking
    into his duplex early Friday morning. Around 5:15 a.m., the guy smashed out the
    back window in the kitchen and entered the house, Johnson said. He was in the
    living room, we think, when my little dog freaked out on the guy. I guess he got
    scared and dove out of the sunroom window and vaulted the fence. A police spokesman
    said officers were called to the scene about the same time and found the man sitting
    on the roof. Johnson said the man startled his 19-year-old daughter, who saw him
    just as he made the 6-foot drop from the sunroom window to the courtyard below.
    A great way to start a Friday, he said.  \r\r"
