    banned, especially in the sanctuaries set up to protect the islands endangered
    coral reefs and replenish fish stocks, in Stewart Town, Jamaica, Friday, Feb.
    15, 2019. The restrictions have taken a toll on many Jamaicans livelihoods, in
    a place where jobs can be scarce. Some say they have to resort to illegal night
    spearfishing to make up for lost wages from the sanctuary''s restrictions. And
    since some fish sleep in the reef at night, they are easier to catch than during
    the day. Other fishermen have joined with local businesses to form marine associations
    and negotiate the boundaries for no-fishing zones. A simple line in the water
    is hardly a deterrent, however, for a boundary to be meaningful, it must be enforced.
    Night spearfishermen wrap their faces to protect against stinging jellyfish. But
    thats not the only threat lurking in the water: In addition to sharks, fishermen
    turned wardens are patrolling, scouting for illegal fishing. '

    night spearfishing, which is banned, in Stewart Town, Jamaica, Friday, Feb. 15,

    down a cliff and into the ocean, the jumping-off point tonight for the night spearfishermen.
    Down those same steps is where some of these men learned to swim as young boys. '
