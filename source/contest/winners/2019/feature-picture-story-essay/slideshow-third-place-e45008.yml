    no-take zone in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019. After a series of
    disasters in the 1980s and 1990s, Jamaica lost 85 percent of its once-bountiful
    coral reefs and its fish population plummeted. But today, the corals and tropical
    fish are slowly reappearing thanks to some careful interventions. More than a
    dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the
    past decade. Local fisherman have joined with local businesses to form marine
    associations and negotiate the boundaries for no-fishing zones. Within these zones,
    pieces of regenerating staghorn coral are grown in nurseries waiting to be tied
    onto rocks in an effort to repair the damage done to reefs by man and nature.
    The no-take zones are patrolled by local fisherman dedicated to seeing the fish
    stock recover, but not everyone is on board. Some spearfisherman with fewer options,
    are the most likely trespassers, illegally catching fish sleeping at night to
    make up for lost wages from the sanctuaries'' restrictions. '

    gather coral from a coral nursery to be planted inside the White River Fish Sanctuary
    Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019, in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. When each stub grows to about the
    size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to individually transplant
    onto a reef, a process akin to planting each blade of grass in a lawn separately.
    Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year. And its not possible
    to simply scatter seeds.

    the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. Its easier

    to see some fish. But not everyone is on board. '
