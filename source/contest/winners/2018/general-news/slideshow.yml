  :caption: Haddam, Ct. - 07/30/2018 - Surrounded by a crowd bellowing, "with liberty
    and justice for all," Haddam Selectwoman Melissa Schlag kneels in front of a United
    States flag as the pledge of allegiance is recited to start her town's board meeting.
    Schlag knelt two weeks earlier, at the town's July 19 meeting, citing her "extreme
    sorrow" for many things related to Donald Trump's presidency including his apparent
    rejection, after meeting with Vladimir Putin, of the U.S. intelligence community's
    assessment that the Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. As part of
    her protest, Shlag also cited the U.S. immigration policy of caging migrant children,
    breaking up migrant families and President Trump's callous treatment of women
    and minorities.

    and child were unsuccessful in their attempt to cross into Mexico and were returned
    to the Guatemalan side. '
