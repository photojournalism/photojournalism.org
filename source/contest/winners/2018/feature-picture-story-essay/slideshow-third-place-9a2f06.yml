    deadliest school shooting in U.S. history with 17 people being killed. One of
    the wounded, Kyle Laman, 16, was shot in the foot during the deadly mass shooting
    in Parkland, FL. He has undergone several surgeries and finds it difficult to
    talk about the events from that day. Doctors are optimistic that he will fully
    recover from his wounds, but his family and friends are focused on helping him
    regain a sense of normalcy that goes deeper that his physical injuries.\r\rA makeshift
    memorial is seen outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Monday February
    26, 2018 in Parkland, FL. A shooting on February 14th at the school left 17 people
