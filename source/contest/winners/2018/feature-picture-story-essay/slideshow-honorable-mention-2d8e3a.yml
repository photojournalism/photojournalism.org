  :caption: Searchers pause against the scenery while looking for clues in the disappearance
    of Ashley HeavyRunner Loring in Babb, Mont., who went missing last year from the
    Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Thursday July 12, 2018. Ashley's disappearance is
    one small chapter in what one senator calls an epidemic, the unsettling story
    of missing and murdered Native American women and girls. No one knows precisely
    how many there are in the U.S., partly because some go unreported and others havent
    been accurately documented. A 2017 analysis by Montanas Department of Justice
    found Native Americans account for 30 percent of missing girls and women _ 22
    of 72 _ even though they represent only 3.3 percent of the state's population.

    Native American women are often subject to high rates of violence. "It becomes

    there''s no deterrence because there''s no enforcement and no prosecution," said
    Heitkamp, who has introduced a bill aimed at addressing this issue. '

    people to speak up. '
