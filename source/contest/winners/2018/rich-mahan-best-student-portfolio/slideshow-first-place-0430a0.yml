    were groups of young Mexican men who banded together for solidarity and fraternity.
    These were the precursors to the the Latino gangs of the American Southwest, that
    kill for pride and territory in cities like Los Angeles and Oakland and Pueblo,
    Colorado. Pueblo is a city that has seen the loss of over 5,000 steel manufacturing
    jobs since the 1960s, and the gangs have become a reality faced by much of Pueblos
    youth. Police have identified more than 1,000 gang members within Pueblo, roughly
    nearly two percent of its population. The murder rate has soared, pushing it to
    the highest per capita in the state. Police Chief Luis Velez attributes this to
    gang rivalries over the gun trade and the exploding drug market. But what is often
    lost in most narratives on gang violence is a community of voices demanding change.
    Frontline churches welcome gang members, addicts, and dealers while former gang
    bangers have begun to mentor the youth and steer them away from repeating their
    pasts. Mothers and fathers who raise babies in gang territory speak of a sacrificial
    love that they must model for their children who are recruited by the gangs as
    early as 10 and 11. These images are of and for them.\r\rCaption: Mourning doves

  :caption: Obdulio Vasquez-Puac was separated from his 8 year old son after they
    crossed the Mexican-American border in Texas in May. Caught up in the Trump administration's
    short-lived family separation policy, Obdulio has been told little of the whereabouts
    of his son and does not know when they will be reunited. Obdulio primarily speaks
    Mam, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala and South Mexico, further complicating
    his situation. He also recalled being robbed by coyotes on the crossing.
