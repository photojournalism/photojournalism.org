    Burroughs erupts after pinning Azerbaijan''s Gasjimurad Omarov 3 minutes and 15
    seconds into their 74 kg/163 lbs. match during the 2018 Freestyle World Cup at
    Carver-Hawkeye Arena. "I''m not a pinner. It''s an art form to be able to pin
    somebody," said Burroughs. "I couldn''t see the ref the way my head was positioned,
    I was just like ''Please slap the mat.'' That was a big moment for me, I don''t
    get guys on their back a lot. All I know is squeeze as hard as I can and hope
    I hear a whistle and people cheer." The former Nebraska wrestler''s four wins
    in the tournament were part of a dominant performance by Team USA, as the Americans
    captured their first World Cup title since 2003 on Sunday with a 6-4 win over
    Azerbaijan in the gold-medal match. '

    was arrested, a GoFundMe page was created to bail White out of jail, which he
    donated to Camps4Heroes, a retreat in North Carolina that seeks to aid veterans
    in getting re-acclimated to civilian life.

    meter relay at the MHSAA Division 4 Boys and Girls Track and Field State Finals
    in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Saturday, June 2, 2018. After the 4x400, the final
    race of the day, the Fowler girls track team claimed the 2018 state title. Goerge
    later said that she started passing out after runs during this season of track
    and now goes down about three times a day. Goerge added that her doctor says he
    has seen multiple cases like hers over the past ten years and Goerge says that
    while it is not common, it doesn't seem to affect her health in any noticable
    way.
