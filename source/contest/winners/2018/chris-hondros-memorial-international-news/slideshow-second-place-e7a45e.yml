    areas of Harare and was known for being a former president Mugabe's stronghold.
    Zimbabweans voted in the country's first presidential election without strongman
    and controversial leader Robert Mugabe, who led the nation for 37 years. General
    elections were held on 30 July 2018 in Zimbabwe to elect the president Within
    days after the election, there were protests by the Movement for Democratic Change
    opposition. The likelihood of the elections taking place was called into doubt
    following the 2017 coup. The army opened fire on demonstrators and bystanders
    and killed six people. In the following days, many opposition supporters were
    arrested, according to opposition leaders and human rights groups.AFP PHOTO /
