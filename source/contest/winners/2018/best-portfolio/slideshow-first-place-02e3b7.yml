    with drug addiction, has been arrested over 50 times in Campbell County. The opioid
    crisis is putting more women behind bars across the U.S. _ tearing apart families
    and squeezing communities that lack treatment programs and permanent solutions.
    In one Tenn. county jail, most female inmates have long-term addiction problems.
    Women in jail are the fastest-growing correctional population in America. Between
    1980 and 2009, the arrest rate for drug possession or use tripled for women, while
    it doubled for men. Opioid abuse has exacerbated the problem.

    her cousin, Lissa Loring, during a traditional blanket dance before the crowd
    at the North American Indian Days celebration on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation
    in Browning, Mont., Saturday, July 14, 2018. The ''dance'' was held to raise awareness
    and funds for Ashley''s search. With just about 1,000 residents on the reservation,
    many folks are related and secrets have a way of spilling out. There''s always
    somebody talking, says Lissa, and it seems like to us since she disappeared, everybody
    got quiet. I don''t know if they''re scared, but so are we. That''s why we need
    people to speak up. '

    arrested in connection with her death.
