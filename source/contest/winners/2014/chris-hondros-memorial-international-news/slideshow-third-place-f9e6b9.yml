    to neighboring countries by plane and truck as Christian militias stage brutal
    attacks, shattering the social fabric of this war-ravaged nation. In towns and
    villages as well as in the capital, Christian vigilantes wielding machetes have
    killed scores of Muslims, who are a minority here, and burned and looted their
    houses and mosques. Tens of thousands of Muslims have fled their homes. The cycle
    of chaos is fast becoming one of the worst outbreaks of violence along Muslim-Christian
    fault lines in recent memory in sub-Saharan Africa, tensions that have also plagued
    countries such as Nigeria and Sudan.\r\r\rA Christian man chases a suspected Seleka
