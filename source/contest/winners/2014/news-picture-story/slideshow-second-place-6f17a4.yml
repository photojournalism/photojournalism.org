    targeting of African-American people by police. \rWeeks of sustained, sometimes
    violent, protests followed. On the most intense nights of unrest some protesters
    threw rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, fired gunshots and set fires. In response
    police used tear gas, rubber bullets and flashbang grenades to break up the crowd.
    \rThe days and weeks have stretched into months of protests. Protesters are calling
    for the arrest of Officer Wilson on murder charges and are seeking wider systematic
