    coming ashore in Lesbos, Greece. More than 500,000 people have arrived in the
    European Union this year, seeking sanctuary or jobs and sparking the EU's biggest
    refugee emergency in decades. Tens of thousands of people trying to escape conflict
    and poverty in places like Syria and Afghanistan have been making their way across
    Europe this summer and fall, embarking on grueling journeys that typically start
    with a short boat trip from Turkey to Greece, then continue north and west on
    foot and by bus and train. \r\rAfghan migrants disembark safely from their frail
    boat in bad weather on the Greek island of Lesbos after crossing the Aegean see
    from Turkey, Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015. "
