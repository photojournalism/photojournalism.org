    constantly telling me I am not good enough, pretty enough, skinny enough - whatever,"
    Elizabeth said. "After a while you can't help but believe them." She said that
    some days recovery is easier than others. She calls her worst days "ED days,"
    which stands for eating disorder days,  because she wants to remind herself that
    her eating disorder does not define her and that the voices in her head do not
    reflect how she truly feels about herself.
