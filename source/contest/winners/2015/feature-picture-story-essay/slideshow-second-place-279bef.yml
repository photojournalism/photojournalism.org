  :caption: 'Suruz Ali (age 25) sits in his non-paying sick ward at the National Institute
    of Diseases of Chest and Hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 8 November 2014. He
    has been in hospital for the last six months and has been suffering TB since 2012.
    He takes medicine home to be cured from MDR TB (Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis),
    but he did not continue to take it. Now he has returned to this hospital. Tuberculosis
    (TB) is a worldwide public health problem. The incident of TB is much higher in
    developing countries such as Bangladesh. The World Health Organization estimates
    that approximately 570000 people are currently suffering from TB disease in Bangladesh.
    Every year more than 300,000 people develop TB and 66,000 TB-related deaths occur
    in Bangladesh. Every day patients get admitted in TB Hospital (NIDCH) National
    Institute of Diseases of the Chest and Hospital in Dhaka and sometimes they have
    to wait a long time for a bed to become available. Across the country, every day,
    nearly 50 patients come to meet the doctors in this hospital. Drug-resistant TB
    (DR-TB) is increasingly spreading from person to person in places around the world,
    with some countries reporting up to 35% of new TB cases as multi-drug resistant
    (MDR-TB). Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has now been reported in 100
    countries, accounting for an estimated 9% of all MDR-TB cases. Globally, access
    to proper treatment is drastically low: only one person in five with MDR-TB receives
    treatment; the rest are left to die, increasing the risk to their families and
    communities and fuelling the epidemic.'
