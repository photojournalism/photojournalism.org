  :caption: As the congregation of Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal
    Church grieves, a pilgrimage occurs daily at a growing makeshift memorial for
    nine parishioners killed during a Bible study class. The memorial became a place
    where anyone could come to heal with prayers, songs, and tears. Just two days
    after the shootings, the men of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. raise their hands
    to lead a crowd in hymns. Each day, hundreds flock to the South's oldest African
    Methodist Episcopal church to show support and witness the scene.

    across the memorial in front of the church. Hours earlier, shooting suspect Dylann
    Roof was captured and charged with killing nine parishioners.  One of the nine
    included the church's pastor and State Senator Rev. Clementa Pinckney.

  :caption: At times the scene outside the church seems more like a tourist attraction
    than a memorial. While mourners gather in prayer, tourists take cell phone photos
    where nine people were shot to death during a Bible study class.

  :caption: Hours after the shootings, it had become clear that a white gunman killed
    the nine members of the South's oldest African Methodist Episcopal church because
    they were black. Community prayer and healing vigil events following the shootings
    helped bring people together. As a result, Charleston did not erupt into violence.  Instead,
    people gathered together at Mother Emanuel  in peace, love and prayer to start
    the healing process.
