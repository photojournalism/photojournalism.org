  :caption: "(Photo shot with Polaroid Type 55 film, not a Photoshop creation) The
    day after he turned 100, Harold Shorty Heins hopped out of his wheelchair, ready
    to tell war stories. And what he saw when the Army sent him to Europe is still
    so hot it can make him cry today, more than 70 years later. I can't really talk
    about it, what people went through at the time. People don't know what suffering
    is. But he also remembers tender moments. Human moments. German soldiers surrendering
    their guns to him but begging to keep their family photos. Starving children asking
    him to shoot a rabbit so they could eat. "
