  :caption: "SUMMARY: This year millions of families are expected to see their homes enter foreclosure. This is the stoy one such family. Hayward Hancock and his wife, Cindy Hooper, met in high school. Many years later Cindy lost her job and the family missed some mortgage payments before they began to regain their financial footing. But it was too late. Their mortgage company had already foreclosed. They turned to a mortgage modification company, Apply 2 Save, to help negotiate with their mortgage company and bring their payments up to date. Apply 2 Save soon filed for bankruptcy, taking $14,000 of the familiy's money with them. Now, in a last ditch effort to save their home, Hayward is working two jobs and they're scrambling to raise enough money to satisfy the mortgage company. But it's an uphill battle and the clock isn't on their side. \"We're going to go down fighting,\" Mr. Hancock says. To save their home, the couple decides to sell as many of their belongings as they can in an endless garage sale. But the mortgage company has other ideas and Hayward and Cindy soon find circumstances turning against them. In this photo, soon after their home enters forclosure, Hayward Hancock, right, and his wife, Cindy Hooper decide to sell as many of their belongings as they can in a 7 day-a-week garage sale. Here they talk about selling the painting at right that they think may be valuable."

"One woman bought a 75-cent ball of yarn and handed me a $100 bill," Mrs. Hooper said. "It's amazing the kindness we've seen."

The notice said he and his family and all their possesions had to be out of the house by December 16.

  :caption: The eviction notice said the family had to be out of the house on December 16th. But early on the morning of Decmeber 8th, the family awakens to a Sheriff's deputy at their front door and a group of repo men in their front yard.  The deputy says the home is being reposessed and they had to leave immediately.  Mr. Hancock tells the deputy that the eviction notice says they have unit the 16th of December.  After some discussion and a few phone calls the deputy says that the date on the eviction notice is a mistake.  The actual date is today. The deputy calls the mortgage company and asks them to honor the date on eviction notice - December 16th.   The mortgage company refuses to give the family any more time. They have to have all their possesions out of their 2,500 sq. ft.double-wide mobile home within four hours.  The family is completely unprepared.  In this photo, Mr. Hancock and his father, right, speak to the repo man, second from left, and a sheriff's deputy, left.
