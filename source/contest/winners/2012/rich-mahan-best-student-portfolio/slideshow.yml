  :caption: Rayford Kytle, 65, from DC, has been living with HIV for more than 30
    years and is attending the XIX (19th) International AIDS Conference to "find out
    what the latest developments are in AIDs prevention, research and care are and
    how I can help with the epidemic," at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center
    in Washington, DC on Wednesday July 25, 2012. Kytle has depression, a side effect
    of an early type of anti-HIV medicine as well as something called facial wasting,
    and requires injections once every 18 months so his face doesnt look "like a walking
    skull." The injections cost $1,500 each. Kytle is lucky enough to have private
    insurance that covers it, but other men in his support group are not so lucky.
