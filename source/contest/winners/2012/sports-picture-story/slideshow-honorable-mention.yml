    - where athletes swim to depths with no breathing apparatus, just a lungful of
    air. The DeJa Blue freediving competition is held annually off Grand Cayman Island,
    where athletes can push their limits under the careful supervision of multiple
    layers of safety divers...THIS IMAGE: Garo Hachigian, safety diver, acclimates

  :caption: Safety Diver Tara Hodgins exhales before surfacing. Before freedivers
    surface, they exhale, so they can immediately inhale when they hit air. The first
    3-6 breaths are called "hook breaths" as they inhale deeply and hold the air in
    for a pause - this increases the preassure in the body and lessons the chance
    of blacking-out. ltqmb "Life and Breath 2".
