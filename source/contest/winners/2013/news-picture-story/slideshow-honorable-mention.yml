  :caption: In this Oct. 2, 2012 photo, a raptor is tethered to the hood of a truck
    to serve as a trapper’s spotter in Egypt's Western Desert. When the bird spies
    a falcon, it looks up, alerting the trapper to release a small bird wearing a

    for a live falcon. (AP Photo/AP Photographer David Guttenfelder on assignment
