    Garment workers and their family members, who became homeless after a five-story
    building collapsed off its base in the Begunbari area, wait in front of makeshift
    accommodation next to the site in Dhaka.<br><br>The garment workers in
    Bangladesh are meagrely underpaid (about 37-38 USD monthly wage), considered the
    lowest wage rate in the world.  The five million workers provide speedy outputs for
    the there are 5,170 RMG factories in the country, which make clothes for international
    brands by employing about 3.5 million workers. The country earns about $21 billion a
    year from garment export, accounting for roughly 80 per cent of its annual export
    earnings. The industrial workers of the Bangladesh garment sectors endure unsympathetic
    working conditions and face discriminations being underpaid than approved basic national
    wage rate. The conditions mirror the hostile situations the European industrial workers
    had to struggle a century ago. Ninety percent of the garment workers are women and girls
    aged above twelve, they are set with the daily tough challenge to execute their work and
    fend against sexual harassments and physical abuses. Around 2500 had been killed by
    incidents like industrial fires and collapse of factory buildings, including the Rana
    Plaza incident, the worldâ€™s one of the largest industrial disaster in the span of five
    years (2005-2013). Police often act brutally to the peaceful protests of the garment
    workers as they often have to take the street to establish their basic needs. "Fashion Victims"
