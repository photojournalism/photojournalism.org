  :caption: Sharron Grovner stands in the backyard of her home in the Hog Hammock community of Sapelo Island, Ga., May 16, 2013. "As we get older, we doubt what the future holds," says Grovner. "In 15, 20 years, I hope and pray that weâ€™ll still be here." Grovner is one of roughly 47 residents, most of them descendants of West African slaves known as Geechee, who remain on Sapelo Island, the coastal Georgia island where their ancestors were brought to work a plantation in the early 1800s. The Geechees have retained their African traditions more than other African American communities in the U.S. Once freed, the slaves were able to acquire land and created settlements on the island, of which only the tiny 464-acre Hog Hammock community still exists. Residents say a sudden tax hike, lack of jobs, and development is endangering one of the last remaining Geechee communities from Florida to North Carolina. "Endangered Geechee"
