  :caption: 'A Truth and Reconciliation Commission estimated that Peru’s 1980-2000 conflict claimed nearly 70,000 lives, most of them poor, Quechua-speaking people. Some 15,000 of them disappeared. Yet fewer than 3,000 bodies have been exhumed because the country has lagged in healing the wounds of its war. The region chronicled here endured some of the worst atrocities of the conflict, in which both Maoist-inspired insurgents and security forces committed grave human rights violations. In this June 13, 2013 photo, Aquilina Cardenas, right, and her sister Luciana, look into the coffin containing the remains of their father in a forensic laboratory, in Ayacucho, Peru. Their father is one of the Chaca residents tortured and killed on Jan. 8,1988 by Shining Path militants in retaliation for forming a self-defense committee. The remains of the victims were exhumed in 2012 from a mass grave and released to family members on June 13, 2013. A mass burial was held in Chaca two days later. "War Scars"'
