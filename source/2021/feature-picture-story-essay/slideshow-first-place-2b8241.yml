    sights on stamping out the scourge of narcotics addiction, even if by force. At
    nightfall, the battle-hardened fighters turned policemen scour the capitals drug-ravaged
    underworld. Below Kabuls bustling city bridges, amid piles of garbage and streams
    of filthy water, hundreds of homeless men addicted to heroin and methamphetamines
    are rounded up, beaten and forcibly taken to treatment centers. The heavy-handed
    methods are welcomed by some health workers, who have had no choice but adapt
    to Taliban rule. We are not in a democracy anymore, this is a dictatorship. And
    the use of force is the only way to treat these people, said Dr. Fazalrabi Mayar,
    working in a treatment facility. He was referring specifically to Afghans addicted
    to heroin and meth.  \r\rDrug users consume heroin in Kabul, Afghanistan, Friday,
