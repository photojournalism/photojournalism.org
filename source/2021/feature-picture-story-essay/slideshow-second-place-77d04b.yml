    home as her family fights with one another just days after Bre-Annas family was
    evicted from their home on Thursday, April 1, 2021 in Fresno, California. \r\rDespite
    a moratorium on evictions due to the coronavirus many evictions are still occurring
    throughout the state. The Valenzuelas received eviction notices but not under
    their name and they say they thought it was a mistake. In reality, the owner of
    the house sold it to a real estate company who plans to flip the house. \r\rFollowing
    the eviction from their home, the immediate family was fractured. Bre-Annas mother
    Danetta wanted to move the family to Alabama but her father Brian did not want
    to go and was worried that Danettas health would fail her because she has kidney
    failure and heart problems which were complicated further by their eviction.Eventually
    Danetta left the family behind in hopes of more stability but died of a heart
    attack two days into the road trip back. Bre-Anna and her father stayed at her
    grandparents home with an unknown future."
