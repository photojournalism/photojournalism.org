  :caption: "Twenty years after the attacks of Sept. 11, and just days after the Taliban
    took control of Kabul, these athletes here are a small group of American combat
    veterans competing in the Tokyo Paralympics -- a corps of elite athletes who have
    triumphed over catastrophic injuries they suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan. They
    are a disparate group. Some are relentlessly optimistic. Others spent years wrestling
    emotional demons. Some insist they emerged from their personal battlefields without
    emotional scarring. Others insist thats impossible. Their stories are tangles
    of adversity and redemption, loss and achievement. What unites them is a fierce
    competitiveness and an ability to push past disabilities that can look insurmountable
    to an outsider. And, at times, a quiet anger at people who dismiss them.  \r\rBrad
    Snyder prepares tea for his wife in their kitchen decorated with a flag handcrafted
    by Brooklyn firefighters using recycled firehose, in Princeton, N.J., on Wednesday,
    Aug. 4, 2021. Losing his sight, he says, seems to matter more to other people. "
