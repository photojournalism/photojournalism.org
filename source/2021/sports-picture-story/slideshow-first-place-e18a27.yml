  :caption: "Photo-Story about the four-year-old motocross rider Luca Albrecht who
    has been riding a motorcycle since he was two years old. He lives with his parents
    Julia Rauch and Kevin Albrecht in Viernau, in southern Thuringia in Germany. The
    family's father, grandpa, uncle and cousins also ride motorcycles themselves.
    Luca trains almost every day with his Husqvarna TC50 in the Viernau Saugraben
    on the Motocross track run by Endurofreunde Haselgrund e.V. In August this year,
    Luca drove his first official race and, in 5th place, also got his first trophy.
