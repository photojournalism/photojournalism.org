    New Marshfield, Ohio, is a small town of around 300 residents nestled among the
    foothills of the Appalachians. In decades past, New Marshfield was a bustling
    town as trains brought coal from the mines in the surrounding area to Cincinatti
    and beyond. However, first the trains stopped, then the coal mines shut down and
    finally the tracks were pulled up. Now, like the tracks, a hotel, gas stations,
    stores and restaurants are all gone. In a town where the primary asset is quiet,
    a variety of small communities find ways to spend their time when not commuting
    to Columbus or other nearby cities for work.

    drug peddlers and pit bulls," he said.

    who now, as adults, bring their own sons and daughters to services.

    to head to her daughter, Melanie Shaulis's, house before her daughter leaves for
    work and her grandchildren wake up on Monday, September 22. Danita normally watches
    the children from six in the morning until five in the afternoon when either Melanie
    or her husband Josh Shaulis return home.\r\rAfter 30 years of teaching, the last
    thing Danita McLaughlin thought was that she would spend the next few years surrounded
    by even more children. However, after her two daughters, Miranda and Melanie,
    began to have families of their own, she immediately stepped into her new role
    of the always-available grandmother. I wasnt planning on babysitting, Danita McLaughlin
    said. That wasnt ever in my mind after retiring. Now based on the day of the week,
    she and her husband are part of a musical chairs game of grandchildren as they
    go to various homes and are dropped off and picked up by a rotation of parents.
    \r\r During the pandemic, Danita said she was relieved that she could watch the
    grandchildren and keep them within the family pod. Her main difficulty was entertaining
    the younger kids with drawing and games while trying to to run a grandma school
    for the older kids who were missing in-person learning. \r\r I just felt fortunate
    because so many of my friends couldnt be together with their kids, she said. \r\r
    Although some days she comes home dead tired, Danita wouldnt trade all the extra
    time she gets to have with her grandchildren as they grow up. She knows they wont
    always need her to change their clothes, cook them breakfast, or be able to fall
    asleep on her lap while she reads to them, so she cherishes every moment she has
    now."
