    died while sleeping when part of her home collapsed as Haitians cope with the
    aftermath of a massive earthquake in Maniche, Haiti on August 21, 2021.  \r\rSUMMARY:
    \ \rIf there is life, there is hope  Chrislom Adonnia, Survivor\r\rA massive 7.2
    magnitude earthquake struck Haiti at 8:29 AM EDT on August 14, 2021.  It affected
    a large area of rural southwestern provinces, killing at least a confirmed 2,250
    people and injuring 12,000. Countless families were displaced, leaving the Caribbean
    Island nation in the grip of yet another humanitarian crisis.  \r\rDuring a wake
    for Marie Herese Atimeus, vibrant villagers danced till dawn on the ruins of the
    home where she died. They sang, drank, partied.  Dominoes games lasted throughout
    the night under a full moon.  The next day they grieved as daughters threw themselves
    to the ground wailing. Grandchildren were passed over the gravesite in a poignant
    tradition and a sons sorrowful cries of Mama, Mama echoed through the air after
    the casket was lowered into the earth of their backyard.\r\rOn good days, life
    is desperately hard in Haiti.  A land of juxtapositions  a breathtaking beauty
    of spirit and a brutal reality of the streets.  Tragedy befalls the country repeatedly.
    \ Political anarchy, gang violence, natural disasters and endless floods.  In
    2010 a massive quake killed over 300,000 people in Port-au-Prince.  Ten years
    later the island country still hadnt recovered when the earth trembled again and
    life for so many was again eternally altered.\r\rAn initial rush to rescue soon
    became recovery as bodies were pulled and quickly buried.  But for most Haitians
    its not about dying in the quake but rather living in the rubble of shattered
    lives and altered destinies where the legendary Haitian resilience survives.  They
    mourn, pray then move on with the task of living.  \r\rThe town of Maniche is
    a teeth-rattling bumpy drive from Les Cayes where approximately 90% of buildings
    were destroyed or damaged. Yet hope endures in the wounded landscape.\r  \rMost
    residents initially sleep on the streets in fear of dangerous aftershocks numbering
    well over 300 in the early weeks after the disaster. But with nowhere to go and
    plagued by tropical rains, they eventually move back inside fragile walls in imminent
    peril of collapse. \r\rBrass bands lead funeral processions past broken buildings.
    \ Still, life goes on.  Amid the rubble women still have hair weaves braided,
    children frolic in play. Creole hymns waft through the air during church services
    as worshippers kneel in pews outside fallen buildings, an elderly matron removes
    dirt and green chunks of concrete from the floor of their house, one shovel at
    a time.\r\rMen salvage iron from the wreckage to sell for direly needed income.
    \ Aid is hampered by gang wars until a truce is declared to allow convoys to pass.
    \ On the road to Maniche, the body of a gang member burns as local vigilantes
    serve up mob justice in a land where no law exists.  Folks rejoice as Chinook
    helicopters land in soccer fields and WFP convoys traverse rivers bringing much
    needed support.  Hands reach out for relief as frustrated townspeople fight for
    a bag of rice, a can of cooking oil. The elderly and most fragile are left empty
    handed, unable to navigate the unruly crowds.\r\rIndeed, it takes a village as
    neighbors help each other heal while awaiting international aid.  A family builds
    a foundation in the driving rain after a week of huddling together during nights
    outside across town.  Pure joy erupted among the residents as precious tents were
    placed on the empty space that once housed their memories - amid clotheslines
    of recently washed laundry and the wreckage of their former lives. Indeed, there
    is no place like home.  \r\rThey lost their 2-year-old daughter and cling to their
    surviving baby with a cast on his broken leg.  He was found under the dead body
    of his uncle on this lot where they strive to now rebuild.  They had to quickly
    bury their child in an unmarked grave, with plans to make something pretty in
    her memory after the immediate crush of basic survival chores wane.  She was so
    intelligent, they proclaim proudly. She made everyone laugh and loved animals.
    \ They find comfort believing she went directly to heaven.\r\rIf there is life,
    there will always be the death.  But we cant be sad when the death comes.  We
    must be strong, stated her father Chrislom Adonnia as he spoke of Gods grace.\r"

    is desperately hard in Haiti.  A land of juxtapositions  a breathtaking beauty
    of spirit and a brutal reality of the streets.  Tragedy befalls the country repeatedly.

    were destroyed or damaged. Yet hope endures in the wounded landscape.\r  \rMost
    residents initially sleep on the streets in fear of dangerous aftershocks numbering
    well over 300 in the early weeks after the disaster. But with nowhere to go and
    plagued by tropical rains, they eventually move back inside fragile walls in imminent
    peril of collapse. \r\rBrass bands lead funeral processions past broken buildings.

    outside across town.  Pure joy erupted among the residents as precious tents were

    surviving baby with a cast on his broken leg.  He was found under the dead body
