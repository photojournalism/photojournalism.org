    territories since the 1994 end of a separatist war. Fighting resumed in late September
    2020 and have now ended with an agreement that calls for Azerbaijan to regain
    control of the outlying territories as well as allowing it to hold on to parts
    of Nagorno-Karabakh that it seized during the fighting. Nagorno-Karabakh lies
    within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by
    Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh
    itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.\rIn 44 days of
    fighting that began in late September and left more than 5,600 people killed on
    both sides, the Azerbaijani army pushed deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia
    to accept last months peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim much of the separatist
    region along with surrounding areas. Russia deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers
    for at least five years to monitor the peace deal and to facilitate the return
    of refugees.\r\r\r\rA man with an Armenian national flag visits the 12th-13th

    of intense fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, some Armenian-held territories,
