    expulsion of people from their homes, and the United States has declared ethnic
    cleansing in western Tigray. Now, on top of those atrocities, Tigrayans face another
    urgent problem: hunger and starvation.The Tigray conflict has displaced more than
    1 million people, the International Organization for Migration reported in April,
    and the numbers continue to rise. \r\rAbeba Gebru, 37, from the village of Getskimilesley,
    holds the hands of her malnourished daughter, Tigsti Mahderekal, 20 days old,
    in the treatment tent of a medical clinic in the town of Abi Adi, in the Tigray
    region of northern Ethiopia, on Tuesday, May 11, 2021. She had the baby at home
    and walked 12 days to get the famished child to a clinic in the northern Ethiopian
    region of Tigray. She survived because I held her close to my womb and kept hiding
    during the exhausting journey.\" "
