    in the Mediterranean, buckled under the strain after more than 8,000 people crossed
    into Spanish territory during a short period in May. The Spanish city of 85,000
    in northern Africa, faced a humanitarian crisis after thousands of Moroccans took
    advantage of relaxed border control in their country to swim or paddle in inflatable
    boats into European soil. Spain deployed its military to the Moroccan border as
    thousands of migrants jumped fences or swam onto European soil.\r\rSpanish Army
    soldiers expel a migrant from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, on Tuesday, May 18,
    2021. "
