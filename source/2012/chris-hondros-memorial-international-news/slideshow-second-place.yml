    have been the target of weeks of Syrian shelling and air attacks as part of wider
    offensives by President Bashar Assad's regime. Rebels have been driven from some
    areas, but the report of clashes near the airport suggests the battles could be
    shifting to new fronts. (AP Photo/ Khalil Hamra)

    over the bodies of four members of his family, who were killed when an airstrike
    hit their house, as they lie on the side of the street outside a field hospital
    in Aleppo, Syria. Its forces stretched thin on multiple fronts, President Bashar
    Assad's regime has significantly increased its use of air power against Syrian
    rebels in recent weeks, causing mounting civilian casualties. The shift is providing
    useful clues about the capability of the air force as Western powers consider
    the option of enforcing a no-fly zone over the northern part of the country.(AP
