  :caption: On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik gunned down 69 people on the Island of Utoya and killed 8 people with a truck bomb in Oslo. In the days and weeks after the country's worst mass killing since World War II, there was an outpouring of grief. Flowers, letters and gifts piled up outside the Oslo Cathedral.   Friends and family of those murdered quietly grieved across the nation.  Playing dead to escape death and witnessing their friends being killed weighed heavily on the teenagers who survived. The tight-knit group of young political activists who attended the summer camp on Utoya Island say they have grown even tighter through adversity. Mourners, unable to fit into the tiny wooden church in Nesodden, outside Oslo, gather for the funeral for Bano Rashid.  Rashid, a young woman who was one of 77 people killed by gunman Anders Behring Breivik, at Nesodden Church outside Oslo Friday afternoon.
