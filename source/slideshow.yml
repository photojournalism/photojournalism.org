    staggered and fell, knocking him unconscious in an Ebola ward on August 15, 2014
    in the West Point township of Monrovia, Liberia. People suspected of contracting
    the Ebola virus were being sent by Liberian health workers for observation at
    the holding center, a closed elementary school with no electricity,  running water,
    or medication for treatment. As the spread of the Ebola epidemic accelerated last
    summer, Liberia's national health system collapsed, and most hospitals and clinics
    closed. The government tried to quarantine the congested township of West Point
    with the Liberian Army, and had to lift it 10 days later in failure. Thousands
    of people died before international aid organizations had built Ebola treatment
    centers with enough to care for the sick. Liberians watched as health care workers
    in hazmat suits carried away their loved ones for cremation, a practice foreign
    to Liberia and traumatic for surviving family members. As the year wore on, the
    end of the epidemic was no where in sight.

    S.C. Built during slavery, they were small places of worship for the Gullah and
    still serve an important spiritual role in the Gullah community. The Gullah Geechee
    people are direct  descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to America
    from West Africa. The Gullah Geechee Coast extends for hundreds of miles between
    Cape Fear, N.C., and the St. Johns River in Florida. In 2004, the National Trust
    for Historic Preservation named the Gullah Geechee Coast one of the 11 most endangered
    placed in the United States.
