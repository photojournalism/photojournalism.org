  :caption: "The 2020 Dakar Rally was the 42nd edition of the event and the first
    edition held in Saudi Arabia. The event started in Jeddah on 5 January and finished
    in Al-Qiddiya 17 January after 12 stages of competition. The rally is an off-road
    endurance event. The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than
    that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road
    vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. \r\rA tail of
    dust from a race car is seen during stage two of the Dakar Rally, between Al Wajh
    and Neom, Saudi Arabia, Monday, Jan. 6, 2020. "
