    \"capeas\", a popular minor bullfighting festival in which bulls are fought for
    fans according to the customs of each locality . He was an outstanding participant
    in the \"capeas\" of the Carnaval del Toro 2019. In 2020, after a great sacrifice,
    he has achieved great recognition in Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain).\r"
