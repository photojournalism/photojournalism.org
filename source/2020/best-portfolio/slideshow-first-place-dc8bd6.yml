    and burial plot for a funeral can run into the hundreds of dollars, or more. In
    Venezuela, most earn the minimum wage of roughly $3 a month as hyperinflation
    devours pay.\rSome overcome the financial burden of a relative's death by renting
    caskets, a cheaper option than buying one. Others turn to amateur morticians,
    who embalm bodies at home and convert wooden furniture into coffins.\rFor many
    in Maracaibo, Venezuela's economic crash in the last five years hit especially

    with a dignified death.\rCommunity activist Carolin Leal has assumed the role
    of funeral director in her poor and often violent Maracaibo neighborhood of Altos
    de Milagro Norte, hoping to rid families of unnecessary misery she's seen too
    many times. Leal, 42, has formed a team with two other neighbors who employ their
    unique skills to bring dignity to the dead. One busy month recently, Leal said
