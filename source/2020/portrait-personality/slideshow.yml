    portrait project that is ongoing. '

  :caption: 'An image of veteran Charles Lowell is projected onto the home he shared
    with his wife, Alice, for 30 years as she stands at left with her daughter, Susan
    Kenney, in Hardwick, Mass. Saturday, May 2, 2020. Lowell, a U.S. Air Force veteran
    and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from the COVID-19
    virus at the age of 78. Each of their stories was different, but common strains
    repeat: Of humility and generosity; of finding joy in the unpretentious; of a
    sharp mind disappearing into fog or a hale body betrayed by age. And, of service,
    in war or in peace, that often went unspoken when they returned home. In their
    final years, these veterans found their place at the Holyoke Soldiers Home in
    Massachusetts. And in their final days, as the coronavirus engulfed the home and
    killed more than 70, they found battle again. Seeking to capture moments of private
    mourning at a time of global isolation, the photographer used a projector to cast
    large images of veterans on to the homes as their loved ones are struggling to
    honor them during a lockdown that has sidelined many funeral traditions. Lowell,
    78, was a missile guide technician and an IBM operations manager. Along the way,
    his life was littered with good deeds, the troubled teenager hed take in, the
    hungry family hed help with groceries, done with little notice or unmentioned
    altogether. He didnt tell people things like that, his daughter Susan Kenney says.
    She remembers a father always teaching her something new and always trying to
    make people laugh, something his wife, Alice Lowell, says his colleagues appreciated.
    It wasnt like going to work, she says of the man she knew since she was a child.
    It was going to play with Chuck. '
