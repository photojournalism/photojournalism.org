  :caption: "In late 2019, civil protests took place throughout Chile in response
    to a raise in the Santiago Metro's subway fare, the increased cost of living,
    privatization and inequality prevalent in the country. The protests began in Chile's
    capital, Santiago, as a coordinated fare evasion campaign by secondary school
    students which led to spontaneous takeovers of the city's main train stations
    and open confrontations with the Carabineros de Chile (the national militarized
    police force). The demonstrations morphed into a massive protest movement demanding
    improvements in basic services and benefits, including pensions, health, and education.
