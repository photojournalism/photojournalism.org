    takes place commemorating the 41st anniversary of PKK on Qandil Mountain in the
    Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sunday Nov. 29, 2019. Fierce fighting with Turkey
    waged with the insurgency into NE Syria after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew
    troops, which was widely viewed as a betrayal of Kurdish allies. Turkey has deemed
    the PKK a terrorist organization and the ongoing conflict with them has been stated
    as a main reason for the insurgency.  Kurdish PKK fighters are based in the mountains
    of this region and many people taking part in the party have lost family members
    to the fighting. Turkeys intent was to establish a safe zone using sophisticated
    drones and air artillery, but a proclaimed ceasefire did not hold as wounded were
    rushed to hospitals and civilians fled besieged cities.  "

    is not safe by any definition. It is the zone of the Turkish invasion. Weve seen

    no ceasefire this whole time.
