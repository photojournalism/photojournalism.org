  :caption: "Homeless child Theo Schrager, 7, holds on to his mother Leah Naomi Gonzaless
    hand as they visit a friends tent at the Gilman Street underpass in Berkeley,
    California, on Friday, June 12, 2020. \r\rTheo was born homeless and has spent
    his life in unstable housing situations. For nearly two years, Theo and his mother
    have been sleeping on the streets and in hotels after their RV was towed in July
    of 2018. Theo dreams of having a home one day where he can \"bake chocolate cakes
    in an oven\" and run around the house with a dog.\r\rIn 2019 Berkeleys official
    homeless count showed no families with children that were unsheltered in the city.
    But Berkeley officials know well that Theo bounces between the citys streets and
    hotels with his mother. Berkeley says they have tried several times to help the
    two find stable housing, without success.\r\rChildren like Theo who grow up on
    the streets face further troubles as they age, studies show. They have higher
    levels of emotional, behavioral and health problems, and are more likely to be
    separated from their families. They also have an increased risk of becoming homeless
    as adults. "

    at the Fiesta del Toro in Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain). He managed to get out on the
    shoulders of the Ciudad Rodrigo bullring after cutting 2 ears on a very emotional
    afternoon. This is the story of a \"briefcase\", a young man who, without means
    and without help, tries to enter the world of bullfighting by participating in
    \"capeas\", a popular minor bullfighting festival in which bulls are fought for
    fans according to the customs of each locality . He was an outstanding participant
    in the \"capeas\" of the Carnaval del Toro 2019. In 2020, after a great sacrifice,
    he has achieved great recognition in Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain).\r"
