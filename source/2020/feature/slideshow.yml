    hand as they visit a friends tent at the Gilman Street underpass in Berkeley,
    California, on Friday, June 12, 2020. \r\rTheo was born homeless and has spent
    his life in unstable housing situations. For nearly two years, Theo and his mother
    have been sleeping on the streets and in hotels after their RV was towed in July
    of 2018. Theo dreams of having a home one day where he can \"bake chocolate cakes
    in an oven\" and run around the house with a dog.\r\rIn 2019 Berkeleys official
    homeless count showed no families with children that were unsheltered in the city.
    But Berkeley officials know well that Theo bounces between the citys streets and
    hotels with his mother. Berkeley says they have tried several times to help the
    two find stable housing, without success.\r\rChildren like Theo who grow up on
    the streets face further troubles as they age, studies show. They have higher
    levels of emotional, behavioral and health problems, and are more likely to be
    separated from their families. They also have an increased risk of becoming homeless
    as adults. "
