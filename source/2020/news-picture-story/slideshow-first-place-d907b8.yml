  :caption: "Massive explosions rocked downtown Beirut on Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020, flattening
    much of the port, damaging buildings and blowing out windows and doors as a giant
    mushroom cloud rose above the capital. The country was already turbulent and the
    explosion just added tension to the city of Beirut. Witnesses saw many people
    injured by flying glass and debris. A large amount of ammonium nitrate stored
    at the port of the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, exploded, causing at
    least 203 deaths, 6,500 injuries, and US$15 billion in property damage, and leaving
    an estimated 300,000 people homeless. This series chronicles the days after the
    explosions. \r\r\rDemonstrators run from tear gas fired by police near the parliament
    building during an anti-government protest, following last Tuesday's massive explosion
    which devastated Beirut, Lebanon, Monday, Aug. 10, 2020. "
