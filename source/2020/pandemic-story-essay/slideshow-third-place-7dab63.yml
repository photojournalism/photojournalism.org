  :caption: 'An image of veteran Charles Lowell is projected onto the home he shared
    with his wife, Alice, for 30 years as she stands at left with her daughter, Susan
    Kenney, in Hardwick, Mass. Saturday, May 2, 2020. Lowell, a U.S. Air Force veteran
    and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from the COVID-19
    virus at the age of 78. Each of their stories was different, but common strains
    repeat: Of humility and generosity; of finding joy in the unpretentious; of a
    sharp mind disappearing into fog or a hale body betrayed by age. And, of service,
    in war or in peace, that often went unspoken when they returned home. In their
    final years, these veterans found their place at the Holyoke Soldiers Home in
    Massachusetts. And in their final days, as the coronavirus engulfed the home and
    killed more than 70, they found battle again. Seeking to capture moments of private
    mourning at a time of global isolation, the photographer used a projector to cast
    large images of veterans on to the homes as their loved ones are struggling to
    honor them during a lockdown that has sidelined many funeral traditions. Lowell,
    78, was a missile guide technician and an IBM operations manager. Along the way,
    his life was littered with good deeds, the troubled teenager hed take in, the
    hungry family hed help with groceries, done with little notice or unmentioned
    altogether. He didnt tell people things like that, his daughter Susan Kenney says.
    She remembers a father always teaching her something new and always trying to
    make people laugh, something his wife, Alice Lowell, says his colleagues appreciated.
    It wasnt like going to work, she says of the man she knew since she was a child.
    It was going to play with Chuck. '

    Eileen Driscoll, left, as she looks out the window with her sister, Patricia Creran,
    in Holyoke, Mass., Thursday, May 7, 2020. Healy, a U.S. Army Korean War veteran
    and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from the COVID-19
    virus at the age of 91. Healy loved corny jokes and adored his family. He devoured
    history and was quick with facts on U.S. presidents. He was humble. He won a Bronze
    Star, but his family only found out how decorated a soldier he was when he was
    gone. He was a longtime U.S. Postal Service employee who rose to become a town
    postmaster. He was sharp as a tack and liked to deem things snazzy or classy.
    On his last night, the nurses gave him chocolate ice cream and showed him photos
    of some young relatives. And by dawn, he was gone. '

    she grew up in with her sister, Tammy Petrowicz, left, and brothers, Paul, center,

    in the U.S. Air Force and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died
    from the COVID-19 virus at the age of 73. Pinard had a life with struggles: A
    marriage gone sour, the pressures of raising two children on her own, family rifts
    that grew worse with an aggressive case of dementia. But there were so many joys,
    too: The miles she drove in her Jeep or flew in the air to reach new places as
    a travel nurse, the rank of captain she achieved, the thrill of meeting Barry
    Manilow, the musician she loved. Her sister Tammy Petrowicz remembers a woman
    overflowing with energy like the Energizer Bunny, who was 16 years older but still
    could run circles around me. '

    son, Tom Sullivan, left, as he looks out a window with his brother, Joseph Sullivan,
    in South Hadley, Mass., Monday, May 4, 2020. Sullivan, a U.S. Army WWII veteran
    and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from the COVID-19
    virus four days shy of his 100th birthday. Sullivan grew up with nothing and appreciated
    everything, a consummate gentleman who found joy in the small things, the Red
    Sox on TV, a cold Bud Light in his hand, a fresh tomato out of the garden. Sullivan
    was an artillery technician in the Army during WWII who won the Bronze Star. He
    had a mischievous side, as evidenced by the time his father told him he couldnt
    play ball because he had to paint the garage. He obliged, painting it top to bottom,
    windowpanes and all. He was a liquor store clerk, a school custodian and a city
    councilman, a man who always beamed with a smile right up to the end of his life.
    Quiet, unselfish, inquisitive about others. How you doing, pal? hed ask. Whenever
    someone would ask him the same, he offered something similar: Never had a bad
    day.'

    Elizabeth DeForest, as she looks out the window of a spare bedroom as her husband,
    Kevin, sits downstairs in Chicopee, Mass., Sunday, May 3, 2020. Kulig, a U.S.
    Navy veteran and resident of the Soldier''s Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from
    the COVID-19 virus at the age of 92. After saying goodbye to her father for the
    last time in person, Elizabeth slept in the spare bedroom upstairs for two weeks
    as a precaution against possibly infecting her husband. Kulig always had a smile
    on his face and hard candies in his pocket. The list of roles he played was long:
    veteran of World War II and Korea, devoted Boston sports fan, bingo caller, school
    dance chaperone, altar server, soup kitchen volunteer, Knights of Columbus member.
    I use the word fierce to describe him, his daughter says. He was really fiercely
    proud of his family. He was fierce in the way that he practiced faith and he taught
    it to our family and to all of us. Just fierce in the way he loved and protected
    the people that mattered to him. '

    improving things wherever he went. He restored cars and could repair just about
    anything, and in the lives of his three children, he was the jack-of-all-trades
    father who knew how to make them smile. His son Randy remembered his father giving
    him bear rides around the living room, rubbing his beard against his little face
    and buying him a go-kart. Later, the elder LaPlante took his son under his wing
    and taught him about being a machinist, a career he holds to this day. I dont
    know where I would be without him, LaPlante says. '

    school teacher. When he spoke, you listened, because he didnt waste his words,
    his daughter-in-law Cheryl Malandrinos says. He always had a joke, was a master
    woodworker, avidly rooted for the Patriots, Red Sox and Bruins and would happily
    settle for Family Feud if his teams werent on TV. He was pretty much the working
    class guy that represents so many of us, Cheryl says.'

    ear. He loved a cup of coffee and something sweet from Dunkin Donuts. He kept
    the nurses at the home laughing. He was fiercely protective of his family. Ask
    his family about the man they lost, and the words flow easily about the card-carrying
    union carpenter, Army veteran, devoted husband of 54 years and father of four.
    He was strong. He was funny. He was engaging. He was ornery. He was feisty, his
    daughter, Keri, says. He was still full of life. And then within days, hes gone.

    of the Soldier's Home in Holyoke, Mass., died from the COVID-19 virus at the age
    of 88. Benson whistled a lilting song throughout his life, one of the things imprinted
    on the minds of those who loved him, like the way hed stir sugar into his morning
    coffee or holler for a visitor to return the minute they stepped out the door.
    His daughter Robin Benson Wilson calls them comfort sounds that signaled the world
    is good. He was a towering 6-foot-4. He made friends easily and often, always
    finding a familiar face wherever he went. He was a mechanic in the Korean War
    and it seemed like he could fix anything. With old age, his ability to whistle
    faded. But during a Christmastime visit by Benson Wilson to the Soldiers Home,
    her father managed to pucker his lips and offer a bit of that familiar tune one
    last time.

    it didnt take long for his Hollywood visions of battle to dissolve into the reality
    of watching friends die. After the Germans were defeated, DiPalma was sent to
    Nuremberg, where he made copies of documents detailing war crimes, watched over
    Nazis in their prison cells and stood guard beside the witness box in the courtroom
    where the evils of genocide were detailed. One time, he filled the glass of one
    of the most powerful Nazis, Hermann Goring, with toilet water. Back home in the
    U.S., he lived a life of humility, rarely talking about his service. He did all
    of this in World War II and we hardly knew about it, says his daughter Emily Aho. '

    basketball, even after he started using a wheelchair. Hed play cards with his
    daughter Laurie and, if she left the table, shed return to find the deck had been
    stacked. She took to calling him Cheater Beater. He found joy in babies and dogs
    and for all his fun-lovingness, he imparted something deep in those who were close

    from the COVID-19 virus at the age of 86. Melendez would clam up and appear sad
    when someone would ask about his time in Korea. But he was affectionate and easygoing,
    a man whod let a young relative have a seat on his lap or give them a dollar from
    his pocket, which made them feel rich. He loved the island of his heritage, Puerto
    Rico. He loved dominoes and family gatherings and would jump on a plane whenever
    someone needed him. When he became less independent, he went to live with his
    niece Janet and when he needed more help, he moved to the Soldiers Home, where
    she is a nurses aide. She lost her own father when she was young and as her uncle
    grew sicker, Ramirez slipped away to his room to hold his hand or to play Spanish
    music on her phone and put it to his ear. I felt like he was my dad, she says. '
