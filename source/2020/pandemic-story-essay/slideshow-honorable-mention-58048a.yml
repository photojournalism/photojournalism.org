  :caption: "Manaus is one of the hardest hit cities in Brazil, which officially has
    lost more than 23,000 lives to the coronavirus. But in the absence of evidence
    proving otherwise, relatives are quick to deny the possibility that COVID-19 claimed
    their loved ones, meaning that the toll is likely a vast undercount. As ambulances
    zip through Manaus with sirens blaring and backhoes dig rows of new graves, the
    muggy air in this city by the majestic Amazon River feels thicker than usual with
    such pervasive denial. Manaus has seen nearly triple the usual number of dead
    in April and May. Doctors and psychologists say denial at the grassroots stems
    from a mixture of misinformation, lack of education, insufficient testing and
    conflicting messages from the countrys leaders.\r\rIn this May 14, 2020 photo,
    SOS Funeral workers transport by boat the coffin containing the body of a suspected
    COVID-19 victim that died in a river-side community near Manaus, Brazil. The victim,
    an 86-year-old woman, lived by the Negro river, the largest tributary to the Amazon
    river. "
