    at the Fiesta del Toro in Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain). He managed to get out on the
    shoulders of the Ciudad Rodrigo bullring after cutting 2 ears on a very emotional
    afternoon. This is the story of a \"briefcase\", a young man who, without means
    and without help, tries to enter the world of bullfighting by participating in
    \"capeas\", a popular minor bullfighting festival in which bulls are fought for
    fans according to the customs of each locality . He was an outstanding participant
    in the \"capeas\" of the Carnaval del Toro 2019. In 2020, after a great sacrifice,
    he has achieved great recognition in Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain).\r"
