  :caption: "Today marks the tenth day of confinement due to the coronavirus crisis.
    Jos, 84 years old, tries to pass the time as active as possible without leaving
    home. For him the time goes slowly without being able to enjoy his two favorite
    hobbies: soccer and domino games.\rMoreover, he cant go to the Senior Center where
    he usually went every day on the outskirts of Seville. His family, to make the
    afternoons not so boring and take chance to exercise his mind, prepares exercises
    and drawings for him. Today he completed the first alphabet soup of his life.\r"

    yard of his house looking for light. He escapes from the cold weather by taking
    refuge inside the car, at least a chance to change the landscape of his room.
    Three weeks already confined by a certain coronavirus that  according to what
    some people say, is making a big desaster. A large patio that today, more than
    ever, is a blessing. I look at him from the outside, with a glass in the middle
    that separates us and protects him.\r"
