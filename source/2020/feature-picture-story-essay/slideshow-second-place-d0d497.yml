  :caption: "Death has become an overwhelming financial burden for many of Venezuelas
    poorest, who already struggle to find dignity in life. They scrape together food
    and shelter needed to get through each day, and a relative's death can become
    the breaking point.\rThe cost of transporting a body, buying a casket and burial
    plot for a funeral can run into the hundreds of dollars, or more. In Venezuela,
    most earn the minimum wage of roughly $3 a month as hyperinflation devours pay.\rSome
    overcome the financial burden of a relative's death by renting caskets, a cheaper
    option than buying one. Others turn to amateur morticians, who embalm bodies at
    home and convert wooden furniture into coffins.\rFor many in Maracaibo, Venezuela's
    economic crash in the last five years hit especially hard. \rAmong life's struggle,
    too often comes the need to provide a relative with a dignified death.\rCommunity
    activist Carolin Leal has assumed the role of funeral director in her poor and
    often violent Maracaibo neighborhood of Altos de Milagro Norte, hoping to rid
    families of unnecessary misery she's seen too many times. Leal, 42, has formed
    a team with two other neighbors who employ their unique skills to bring dignity
    to the dead. One busy month recently, Leal said she oversaw 12 funerals.\r\r\r\rZaida
    Bravo, who suffers Parkinson's disease and is malnourished, waits for dinner on
    her dirty mattress in her one room living quarters in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Nov.
    28, 2019. The 48-year-old's sister Ana Bravo brings her food when she can, but
    for the last four years the older sister has had trouble affording even rice or
    cornmeal. We can't find her medicine or even know how to help her, so we're letting
    what happens happen, Ana Bravo, 57, said. Sometimes, I'm afraid to go inside and
    find her dead.  "
