The Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar’s board of directors is pleased to announce that sponsorship from Nikon Professional Services will allow students to attend this year’s event at a steep discount.

The sponsorship, the first of its kind, will reduce a student’s registration fee to $50, a $180 savings from last year. This applies to college and high school students attending the 2016 Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar, the longest continuously-running photojournalism conference in the United States. The Seminar is in its 44th year.

“Nikon Professional Services (NPS) is happy to support young professionals who wish to attend the Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar,” said NPS Sr. Manager Mark Suban. “Nikon supports professional photographers at all levels, including those starting down the path of photojournalism looking to be inspired by world-renowned visual journalists. Everyone has a beginning, and the Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar is one of the many great educational groups dedicated to professional development.”

The $50 registration fee covers photo workshops, video workshops, and featured speakers. The 2016 Seminar will be held Nov. 11-12 at the Atlanta Hilton Northeast. Attendees can register at [photojournalism.org/register](/register/).

Among this year’s faculty is Jessica Rinaldi, the 2016 Pulitzer Prize winner in feature photography, and other world-class visual leaders who are volunteering their time to better prepare the next generation of photojournalists.

“We have an amazing lineup this year and the new level of sponsorship from NPS will make sure that the cost of attending our conference will not overly burden our student attendees,” said APS President Kevin D. Liles. “NPS is a longtime sponsor of the Seminar, and we are more than grateful for their ongoing support.”

The Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar, a volunteer-run, non-profit organization, was founded in 1973 by a group of photojournalists representing newspapers, magazines and wire services. Its aim is to promote the highest standards of photojournalism through an annual educational conference and a photography contest judged by those working in the photojournalism field.
