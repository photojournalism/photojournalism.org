There is less than one month remaining for college students to enter to win the Dave “Mullet” Martin Grant, offered by the Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar. The grant, in its second year, gives one student who wishes to pursue or continue a personal photojournalism project.

The inaugural grant was awarded to Ohio University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate Sara Lewkowicz for her work on her project, “Shane and Maggie.” Lewkowicz is also a faculty member the 2015 Seminar, held Nov. 13-14 at the Hilton Atlanta Northeast.

Lewkowicz, a native New Yorker living in Brooklyn, has been published in Time Magazine, Stern, L’Espresso, Das Magazin, Internatzionale, the Baltimore Sun and numerous other magazines and newspapers. She has won several grants and awards, including first place in Contemporary Issue in World Press Photo, the L’Iris D’Or at the Sony WPO Awards, the 2013 Alexia Student Grant and the 2013 Ville de Perpignan Remi Ochlik Award, and she was named the 2013 College Photographer of the Year by POYi. She has a particular interest in documenting gender and sexuality issues.

Applicants must be currently enrolled in college. A detailed description of the project, including how the money will be spent, is required. Applicants should include a link to their portfolio, as well as to any work already begun on the project. (If the project has not been started, only a portfolio of work is required.) The project can be shot in stills, video, or a combination. Half of the grant will be awarded up front and half will be awarded when the project is submitted. The project must be submitted by Sept. 1, 2016. It will be showcased during the 2016 Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar and displayed on the group’s website. Seminar faculty and staff will determine the winner.

__Students may apply online at [www.photojournalism.org/grants/dave-martin-student-grant/](http://www.photojournalism.org/grants/dave-martin-student-grant/). The deadline for entry is 11:59 p.m., Nov. 1, 2015.__

Martin, a larger-than-life longtime Associated Press photographer, passed away suddenly Jan. 1, 2014, while on assignment at the 2013 Chik-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta. His final photo was a vivid game-ender that summed up his philosophy and drive to get “the picture.” The $1,000 grant in his honor is designed to be awarded to a college student.

__Donations to the grant fund can be made online at the EventBrite page [photojournalism.eventbrite.com](http://photojournalism.eventbrite.com), or by mail to Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar Inc., PMB 420, 5579-B Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Dunwoody, GA 30338, Attn: KEVIN LILES Ref: DAVE MARTIN STUDENT GRANT__

"As we’ve said before, Dave was as much teacher as photojournalist,"" said Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar President Kevin Liles. "This grant helps us share his legacy with others who didn’t get the chance to see him work in person – his desire to help others, teach and share what he had to offer, even to his competitors."
