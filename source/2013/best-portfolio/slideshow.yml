    workers in Bangladesh are meagrely underpaid (about USD 37-38 monthly wage), considered
    the lowest wage rate in the world.  The five million workers provide speedy outputs
    for the there are 5,170 RMG factories in the country, which make clothes for international
    brands by employing about 3.5 million workers. The country earns about $21 billion
    a year from garment export, accounting for roughly 80 per cent of its annual export
    earnings. The industrial workers of the Bangladesh garment sectors endure unsympathetic
    working conditions and face discriminations being underpaid than approved basic
    national wage rate. The conditions mirror the hostile situations the European
    industrial workers had to struggle a century ago. Ninety percent of the garment
    workers are women and girls aged above twelve, they are set with the daily tough
    challenge to execute their work and fend against sexual harassments and physical
    abuses. Around 2500 had been killed by incidents like industrial fires and collapse
    of factory buildings, including the Rana Plaza incident, the worldís one of the
    largest industrial disaster in the span of five years (2005-2013). Police often
    act brutally to the peaceful protests of the garment workers as they often have
    to take the street to establish their basic needs.

    According to a 2012 study by US-based NGO, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, over
    45,000 people in Bangladesh are employed in manufacturing inexpensive cigarettes
    known as bidis and this number includes "many women and children working in household
    based establishments where they make low wages and live in poverty." A 2011 research
    paper about bidi workers in Bangladesh, published in the journal Tobacco Control,
    says that working conditions can involve poor ventilation and exposure to tobacco
    dust, which can cause a range of health problems including respiratory and skin
    diseases. International attention has been focused on workers' safety in Bangladesh
    since the disaster at Rana Plaza, a garment factory complex which collapsed in
    April, killing 1,132 workers.
