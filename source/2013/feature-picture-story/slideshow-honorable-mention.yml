    28, rests during a "down time" shift overlooking the border fence with Mexico
    on June 22, 2011 in Nogales, Arizona. The Pentagon recently extended the deployment
    of some 1,200 guardsmen who were deployed last year to assist with border security
    on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Obama Administration is on track to have detained
    and deported 2 million undocumented immigrants by the end of 2013, with more than
    400,000 last year alone. Border Patrol agents on the ground coordinate with helicopters
    from the office of U.S. Air and Marine, making the border with Mexico a militarized
    zone. Agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), fly out deportees,
    their feet in shackles, daily to most Central American countries. Many deportees
    say they will try to return another day. Detain And Deport'

    According to the Border Patrol, undocumented immigrant crossings have increased

    undocumented workers living in the United States.  Detain and Deport

    who had crossed from Mexico into the United States on April 11, 2013 in Penitas,
    Texas. In the last month the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector has seen
    a spike in the number of immigrants crossing the river from Mexico into Texas.
    With more apprehensions, they have struggled to deal with overcrowding while undocumented
    immigrants are processed for deportation. According to the Border Patrol, undocumented
    immigrant crossings have increased more than 50 percent in Texas' Rio Grande Valley
    sector in the last year. Border Patrol agents say they have also seen an additional
    surge in immigrant traffic since immigration reform negotiations began this year

    of the U.S. With the possibility of federal budget sequestration, ICE released
    303 immigration detainees in the last week from detention centers throughout Arizona.
    More than 2,000 immigration detainees remain in ICE custody in the state. Most

    officials. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, ICE, repatriates
    thousands of undocumented Guatemalans monthly, many of whom are caught in the
    controversial "Secure Communities" data-sharing program which puts local police
    on the frontlines of national immigration enforcement. ICE recently announced
    a set of adjustments to the federal program after many local communities and some
    states, including New York, insisted on opting out, saying immigrants were being
    deported for minor offenses such as traffic violations. Guatemala ranks only second
    to Mexico in the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States.  Detain
