    be filled, assembled and shipped to the front lines from this location in northern
    Syria on June 22, 2013. Running out of weapons and with little help from the outside

    most powerful Free Syrian Army brigades in the area, The Ahrar Suriyah. This factory
    is so secret that most of the fighters have no clue about its existence.
