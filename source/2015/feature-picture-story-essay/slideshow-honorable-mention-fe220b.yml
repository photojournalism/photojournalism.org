    widespread wage cuts, and precarious work conditions, thousands in Spain have
    been unable to make mortgage payments or pay rent and are facing evictions. Others
    have fallen victim to the real estate speculation that linked private companies
    with the government, forcing the expropriation of their own houses.  In Madrid,
    the most vulnerable members of society were suffering under the government's austerity
    measures; the property assets of the state's social housing companies, meant to
    provide housing alternatives for people in need, were being sold off to private
    investors. This work explores the relationship between people and their homes,
    and how they face the evictions.\r________\rPolice stand guard outside Asuncion
    Juanilla Frias' apartment during her eviction in Madrid, Spain, Tuesday, June
    16, 2015. The unemployed woman, 57 years old, lost her foreclosed apartment to

    she used to start a business that went bankrupt. The eviction was postponed with
    a help of  anti-eviction activists that  gathered inside the apartment  surrounded
    by riot police. \r\r"
