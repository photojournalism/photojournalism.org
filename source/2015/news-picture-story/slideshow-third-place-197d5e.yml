  :caption: "Chernobyl 30 years after.\r\rOn April 26, 1986 at 1:24 a.m. a disastrous
    event occurred, the worst technological catastrophe of the modern age, which blighted
    the lives of millions of people. That night reactor number four of the Chernobyl
    nuclear power station exploded. The explosion unleashed tons of radioactive dust
    into the air, where, transported by winds it contaminated both hemispheres of
    our planet, settling wherever it rained. Almost the whole of Europe was fouled:
    65 million people were contaminated. Belarus was the worst hit, with 30% of its
    territory rendered useless and it will take millennia to recover. It is estimated
    that the most contaminated areas stretching over 260.000 square kilometers of
    land, (almost as large as Italy) will return to normal radioactive levels in about
    one hundred thousand years time. Almost 30 years have gone by, so we have another
    ninety  nine thousand, nine hundred and seventy to go \r\rMore than 400.000 people
    were forced to evacuate the area, losing their homes and possessions. At the present
    time nine million people in Belarus, the Ukraine and western Russia continue living
    in areas with very high levels of radioactivity, consuming contaminated food and
    water. Eighty percent of the population of Belarus, Western Russia and North Ukraine
    suffers from various pathologies. After the Chernobyl disaster, in the contaminated
    areas there has been a huge increase in radiation-related tumours, such as leukaemia,
    bone and brain tumours, and also malformations due to genetic mutations, pathologies
    of the senses, cardio  vascular, skeletal and muscular systems. And there will
    be still more effects to come from the women who at the time of the disaster were
    under the age of six and are now starting to have children. Only now will we begin
    to understand the effects of genetic mutation on future generations. \r\ra sunk

    exclusion zone. One of the main squares of the abandoned city of Pripyat, where
    there was the playground, now is invaded and surrounded by trees. Despite the
    high contamination, the absence of humans for so many years has allowed nature
    to regenerate, a contaminated, mutated nature but flourishing.

    Fire burns trees raising radioactive ash that is spread in the air, causing a
    new nuclear fallout. On April 27, 2015 the largest fire ever happened in the exclusion
    zone exploded, burning more than 113 km2 of radioactive forest and throwing back
    tons of radioactive particles into the air. In the background of the city of Pripyat
