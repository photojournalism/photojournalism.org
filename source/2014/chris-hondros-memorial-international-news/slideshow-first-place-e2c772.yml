    staggered and fell, knocking him unconscious in an Ebola ward on August 15, 2014
    in the West Point township of Monrovia, Liberia. People suspected of contracting
    the Ebola virus were being sent by Liberian health workers for observation at
    the holding center, a closed elementary school with no electricity,  running water,
    or medication for treatment. As the spread of the Ebola epidemic accelerated last
    summer, Liberia's national health system collapsed, and most hospitals and clinics
    closed. The government tried to quarantine the congested township of West Point
    with the Liberian Army, and had to lift it 10 days later in failure. Thousands
    of people died before international aid organizations had built Ebola treatment
    centers with enough to care for the sick. Liberians watched as health care workers
    in hazmat suits carried away their loved ones for cremation, a practice foreign
    to Liberia and traumatic for surviving family members. As the year wore on, the
    end of the epidemic was no where in sight.

    the gates and took out the patients, many saying that the Ebola epidemic is a

    used by the Liberian Health Ministry to temporarily isolate people suspected of
    carrying the virus. '

    the boy was never tested for Ebola. '

    seaside slum of 75,000, in an effort to stop the spread of the virus in the capital
    city. The quarantine proved impossible to enforce and was lifted after 10 days.
