  :caption: 'In this photo taken Saturday, Feb. 8, 2014, performers get ready backstage
    before a performance at the Mayak cabaret, the most reputable gay club in Sochi,
    Russia, host to 2014 Winter Olympics. Russia adopted a law last year, prohibiting
    vaguely defined propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and pedophilia.
    The legislation makes it illegal to disseminate information to children even if
    it merely shows that gay people are just like everybody else. At Mayak, packed
    on Saturday night, gay men and women steered away from discussing the law, preferring
    to enjoy life, closeted as it is. About a hundred people were chatting at the
    bar, sitting in armchairs or dancing. Couples were sharing kisses. Everyone was
    waiting for the club''s specialty: a drag show. At 1.30 a.m. on Sunday, the music
    stopped and the show began.'
