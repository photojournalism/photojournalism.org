  :caption: "STORY DESCRIPTION:  Founded in 1948, NASCAR continues to be the largest
    stock car racing organization in the United States. With more than six different
    racing series and sanctioning thousands of races a year, it's where young drivers
    get their start and the veterans build their legacies. Side by side on the track
    at 200MPH, and far from the revving engines, where NASCAR fans revel and introduce
    their families to the sport  - this is a way of life for - not just race car drivers.
