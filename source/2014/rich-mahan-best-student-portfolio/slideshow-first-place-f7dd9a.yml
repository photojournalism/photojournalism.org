    14, and Nevaeh, 5.  Their mother Nichole, 38, has been incarcerated for auto theft
    and drug-related offenses. As a mother to her grandchildren, Mary has encountered
    new financial and emotional challenges that she did not face the first time she
    was a mother.  With Nicholes forthcoming release, Mary hopes her life will return
    back to normal as she relinquishes her duties as a stand-in mother.\r\rMary wipes
    her eyes in frustration and exhaustion after Nevaeh climbed into the front seat
    of Marys moving car.  Nevaeh refused to put her seatbelt on after Mary picked
    her up from school in Tampa, FL on Oct. 8, 2013.  \r"

    and Nevaeh share a bedroom split in half by a large corkboard.  Kyle complains
    about not having privacy or quiet.  Mary cannot afford to provide the children
    with separate rooms because her sole income is monthly social security and disability
    checks.

    without Nevaeh and Kyle would be a sentence to me, she said. It would be like

    head and stomach to help her fall asleep. Mary believes that the night terrors
    are a result of the drugs her daughter Nichole took throughout her pregnancy.  When
    Nevaeh was born, she received small doses of the drugs that her mother took to
    help with Nevaehs withdrawal symptoms.

    video conference calls. Though she cant see her mother, Nevaeh looks in Nicholes
    direction.

    "mommy. "Nichole heard it and thought it was Nevaeh calling her. It wasn't.  It
    was Nevaeh calling me, she said. I was thinking in my head 'God I hope she doesn't
    think I'm trying to steal her children away and making them call me mommy.'  I
    hope I can make her understand that these children needed a mommy while she was
    gone."

    with Nevaeh's incessant pleading for affection and unsure of how to react, Nichole
    scolds Nevaeh. "I'm just letting mom surface," Mary said.  "When we go to visit,
    Nichole does the discipline, so if the children want to know something or ask
    to do something, I tell them that mom is right there. Go ask her."

    and father both abandoning her shortly after she was born, according to Mary.  Whenever

    their home--about ten buildings--because Mary was too exhausted to walk any farther.   On
    raising children for a second time, Mary said, "I don't know how I did it the
    first time around.  The second time around, oh boy is it tough!"

    Annex prison in Ocala, FL.  Mary took out a loan to pay for the gas needed to
    drive to the prison.  "My mind is going in so many directions about Nichole getting
    out and taking over the role of mom, because Nichole is bipolar so it is like
    a double worry, she said. She has never gone down this road before of handling
    two children, bringing them up and handling the stress of everyday living."
